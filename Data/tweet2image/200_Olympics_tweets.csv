Inside the restroom, Philip Chism stabbed the young math teacher in the neck and head, slit her throat with a boxcutter and had sex with her corpse.  Chism then used a recycling bin to haul Colleen's body out of the school and into nearby woods, where he posed with the corpse in a sexual position sending his friends pictures of the mutilated young woman's lifeless body.  Collen will never experience her own children, growing old with someone she loves, all because of the demon pictured below.
