He put me in a room with the guards, then they proceeded to commit their crime until I fainted.״  Just like Hamas, the terrorist organization of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has used the religion of Islam to justify war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Yazidi minority went through genocide, while the world watched and remained silent. Tens of thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered by ISIS, the women were taken hostage and raped as sex slaves. Their children were also raped, many did not survive. The world has remained silent and still does not recognize the Yazidi genocide.   Where were the hundred thousand protesters in London when nearly ten thousand Yazidi women were enslaved by ISIS Islamist terrorists. Thousands of women and girls as young as 9 were tortured and raped by Islamist terrorists in Iraq and Syria for too many years. Did 300,000 people take to the streets of London to protest?   Do they really care about human rights or do they just enjoy celebrating the hate-filled 'anti-Zionist' trend among Labor Party members?"

twitter/1863562268580991324,"This echoes almost exactly my letter of resignation from the party more than two years ago. There is barely a cigarette paper between the party position on Russia’s SMO and that of the imperialists with the denunciations of Putin and the call for the withdrawal of Russian troops. On Iran the party is unfortunately influenced by one individual whose grasp on the region is stuck in the 1980s but launched a smear campaign against me, lying about political positions I held along with communist parties in the region I worked closely with. I was continuously blocked from the CC slate and ignored while I was jailed on my way to Nicaragua in case it boosted my profile during Congress.   The party’s support for a two state solution in Palestine sees it line up behind the Zionists and its slavish backing of Labour is in effect support for a government that is complicit in a genocide in Gaza and the massacre of many Lebanese. Leaving was the best thing I ever did and I’ve never looked back so I congratulate you on your principled resignation. I joined the @CPGBML soon after and remain a proud member of an anti-revisionist communist party that stands on the side of the resistance everywhere and hold true to Marxism-Leninism."
