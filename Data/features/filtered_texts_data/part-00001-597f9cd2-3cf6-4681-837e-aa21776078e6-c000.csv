twitter/1824140978380308540,"I entered the UK with no school certificate but an immigration stamp...  More than 20 years ago, I arrived in the UK as a teenager with no family support, not much formal education, and only $100.   I started studying English and then A-levels at Colleges. When I asked a tutor to help me with Cambridge University interview, he said:  'You are an Afghan refugee, not white, and not privately educated to go to Cambridge.'  A few years later...  Studying at Cambridge and Harvard, I achieved my dream of becoming an NHS doctor and founder of a global humanitarian non-profit Teleheal, and also an innovative mental health service Arian Wellbeing to help everyone in need including hard to reach populations.   It's a lifetime of hardships and rejections that have taught me most in life.   Many young people's dreams have been ended by their school grades today.   My message to them or anyone else is - don't let grades or other people's opinions define who you are. Always believe in yourself and your dreams.  Please consider sharing this message with anyone who might need to hear this today."
