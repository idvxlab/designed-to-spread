twitter/1904438295658148127,今天小米把港股恒生科技带崩了，雷布斯选择在小米股价历史最高位配发新股，预计要吸血400多亿港币。不得不说小米这波操作确实是有点骚了。  今天小米创下历史天量，光一上午就成交600多亿，而整个恒生科技都才成交900多亿。最近一年通过小米汽车，小米从15块狂飙到现在最高近60块，然后在市场看涨情绪爆棚的历史高位，迅速增发套现。  对小米来说，这笔钱当然有可能会给后面带来更大的成长空间，毕竟小米汽车才刚起步一年，产能扩张必然需要钱来砸。只是后面到底能做成啥样，包括市场本身的竞争格局变化，都是说不好的。这波新韭菜们来说，可能就真要体验“年轻人的第一波套牢”了。,2025-03-25T15:40:47,10,2,1
twitter/1929430219615764637,现在华尔街有个业务，就是在美股找濒临被摘牌的微型股，然后操作转型做加密金库。  甚至有机构推销业务的广告语是，如果你们手里已经有很多加密货币，  最好的办法就是把它们装进一家美国上市公司里，然后以更高的价格卖给二级市场的投资者。  这里面有个套利的机制：手上有几亿美元现金，先去币圈买加密货币，然后再将其装进一个上市公司壳中，美股市场立刻就会给出 5 倍以上的账面利润。  比如最近比较火的SharpLink宣布募资 4.25 亿美元私募融资，正式启动以太坊金库战略。  在搞以太坊金库战略之前，都快被摘牌了，公司市值仅约 200 万美元  于是有机构找到这个美股上市公司的壳，希望运作一笔价值 4.25 亿美元的以太坊资产池，这个4.25 亿美元的以太坊资产池来自于Consensys 。  Consensys创始人兼首席执行官Joseph Lubin又是以太坊联合创始人 ，私募交易完成后出任 SharpLink 公司董事会主席  Consensys 及其联合投资方将投入 4.25 亿美元，以每股 6.15 美元的价格购买 SharpLink 的股票，而 SharpLink 将用这笔资金购买以太坊。  现在SharpLink 的股价为 76.7 美元，公司市值达到 55 亿美元。  换句话说，这笔价值 4.25 亿美元的以太坊资产，在美股市场上获得了 55 亿美元的估值，  其资产回报率一周高达12倍，其股价回报，更是一周涨幅高达惊人的30倍。  为啥找这些濒临被摘牌的微型股，主要是有壳资源，而且营收规模很难撑得起作为一家上市公司的各项运营和合规成本。  目前美股主板低于500万美元市值的公司达168家，未来会有更多的宣布投资狗狗币，SOL。,2025-06-02T14:49:46,204,18,42

On parle principalement de grands camions routiers de classe 7, des marques Peterbilt et Kenworth, destinés au transport de marchandises.

twitter/1897245757217874397,"REGARDE DONC QUI PARLE !  Voici des faits qui devraient inciter Trudeau à garder sa langue dans sa poche concernant les accusations de couler l'économie canadienne.  Sous Trudeau (2015-2025), la croissance du PIB réel par habitant a été historiquement basse.   Selon le Fraser Institute, elle s’élève à seulement 0,3 % par an en moyenne, le pire résultat parmi les premiers ministres canadiens ayant servi longtemps depuis des décennies (comparé à 0,5 % sous Harper, 2,4 % sous Chrétien).   Une stagnation des niveaux de vie, avec un PIB par habitant en 2023 inférieur de 7 % à ce qu’il aurait été en suivant la tendance américaine (+4 200 $ par personne).  Sous Justin, la dette fédérale est passée de 616 milliards de dollars en 2015 à environ 1 300 milliards en 2025.   Pendant la pandémie, le déficit a atteint 343 milliards (16 % du PIB) en 2020, un record.   L’investissement des entreprises (hors construction résidentielle) a diminué de 16,3 % entre 2014 et 2022, soit -1,9 % par an.   Trudeau a affaibli la position du Canada face à Trump en ne diversifiant pas assez les exportations (75 % vont aux États-Unis) et en priorisant des enjeux sociétaux sur la robustesse économique.  L’inflation a grimpé après la pandémie, atteignant des sommets (ex. : 6,8 % en 2022), et le coût du logement a doublé sous Trudeau.   $URL[0]",2025-03-05T19:20:12,273,42,119

An 11-month siege ended when General William Howe loaded 9,000 British troops and 1,000 Loyalists onto 125 ships bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. General Washington agreed to a cease-fire during the departure in exchange for sparing the city from destruction. However, some homes and shops were plundered. The British withdrawal boosted American morale and turned New England into a sideshow for the remainder of the war. General Howe, for his part, refitted in Halifax while planning to sail south with his fleet, shifting the focus of the action to the Middle Atlantic region where the navy could assume a more prominent role and more Loyalists awaited to rally to the crown. What seemed impossible a year ago was now a reality; the British had never returned to Boston. With their departure came an end to large-scale military operations in New England. This area, which had done so much to inspire the American Revolution, would now observe events further south, first in the mid-Atlantic states and then in the Carolinas. #RevWar #History #AmRev",2025-03-17T22:24:55,50,2,16

I also saw many previously dead and empty storefronts, now lit with life once again and communicating solidarity and hope by having the flyers of the hostages posted inside the stores’ spaces, on the windows.  There are more good than bad in the world.

For three years, the truth about her suffering has been buried under layers of deception. At the heart of this cover-up lies a fraudulent marriage certificate—an official fabrication designed to justify her captivity. Now, we must act to expose this blatant lie.  A Historic Showdown: The Chained Woman Case’s Defining Moment of Truth  Just days ago, I engaged in a critical confrontation with Deng Fei on WeChat—an exchange that marks the most pivotal moment in this case’s history. This was a direct battle between independent evidence and the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) falsified narratives. It was the ultimate showdown between truth and lies.  The video testimony of Xiao Huamei’s uncle, in which he categorically denies that the Chained Woman is his niece, is the most compelling piece of independent evidence, shattering the government’s claims.  Deng Fei himself admitted that the so-called marriage certificate he published was an “urgently needed piece of evidence” for the CCP—proving that its purpose was never to reveal the truth, but to serve the government’s narrative.  When I pressed Deng Fei with rigorous logic and pointed questions in our WeChat conversation, he was left utterly defenseless. He dodged, stalled, and evaded—completely unable to refute my claims.  The result of this clash is clear: The Chained Woman’s true identity remains concealed, while the government’s fraudulent marriage certificate is merely a tool to keep her legally shackled for life.  We Must Act Before March 8—Let the World Hear Her Cry!  This is not just a personal battle—it is a test of society’s collective conscience. With International Women’s Day fast approaching, we must seize this moment to launch the “Chained Woman March 8th Action.” Through in-depth investigative reporting, widespread social media campaigns, and pressure from international organizations, we must ensure the world sees:  This direct confrontation between independent evidence and CCP-forged lies.  The tragic fate of the Chained Woman.  The brutal reality of China’s systemic human trafficking of women.  The CCP’s tactics of fabricating documents and covering up crimes.  How an innocent woman has been sacrificed to uphold the illusion of a “harmonious socialist society.”  How an entire nation and its institutions have colluded to imprison a helpless victim on the altar of political stability.  We urgently need fearless journalists and the most incisive investigative reporters to drive this media storm forward. To all NGOs, human rights organizations, and independent journalists: Now is the time to act. Join this fight to expose the most critical truth of the past three years.  We cannot allow International Women’s Day to be a hollow celebration while the Chained Woman remains in captivity. It must become a battleground for real women’s liberation and human rights.  Time is running out. Stand with us. Let’s break this chain—together.",2025-02-23T00:47:45,0,0,6

twitter/1668609221594628096,"Have we been conned? Serious question. Afterall Russia spent a huge amount of resources to construct multiple defensive lines but the evidence such as it is may be showing a different picture.  Please if you enjoy my work help my reach with a boost and a RT and I will work hard to earn it.  Long Ass Tweet Warning!  Pre-Counter Offensive it looked like the Russian's MLR was set back from the FLOC likely to reduce exposure to artillery, reduce enemy counter-battery options, drones, patrols and other ISR assets before the battle kicked off. Sensible thing to do, plus importantly it let Russia choose the terrain the main fight would be on.  The Russians had months to site, build and prepare a series of defensive works to receive and absorb any Ukrainian attack using troops who were mostly rested and who had a chance to learn soldier skills and the terrain they would fight on.  So why fight so hard forward of the line now and throw all of that away? This question needs to be answered.  I can understand harassing the AFU as it pushes forward so that when they reach your lines your first real blow hits an exhausted disorganized enemy, but we are not seeing that kind of action.  The evidence so far is compelling, if not absolute. I am going to offer up 4 main points:  1. A counterattack at Makarivka.  2. Barrier troops gunning down retreating Russians.  3. Incredibly high burn rate of FPV drones and other assets.  4. Willingness to expose artillery to counter-battery fire.  At Makarivka Pro-Russian accounts are claiming the 127th MRD launched a counterattack retaking the village. This is very close to the initial start lines as far as artillery goes and brings them into range of Ukrainian guns, drones and missiles that can fight from prepared positions. Ukrainian higher command and support assets are closer and better able to exercise C3 and keep the logistics tail working. Finally, the Ukrainian penetration was not deep enough to create a real flank to hit with enough impact to be operationally important. The attack makes no sense to me.  Ditto the barrier troops gunning down their fellow soldiers. I can totally get leaving blocking forces forward of the MLR to break up the Ukrainian attack with ambushes and pre-sited artillery to wreck their timetable and gain your own side intelligence about enemy movements, equipment and other items we use to cover with SALUTE reports. But, those troops job is to delay, at some point you have to let them fall back. The Japanese had suicide troops; these Russians are not them. Gunning them down only encourages surrender.  The only purpose of barrier troops is to keep men in the line where the MLR is. If the barrier troops are forward, then so is the main effort.  I think this supposition is supported by the incredibly high burn rate of FPV drones, loitering munitions, artillery shells and the early and heavy application of tactical air power. This has killed and injured a lot of Ukrainians and damaged or destroyed a lot of equipment, but it hasn't caught any of them in a sack where things like enfilade fires can make bad situations absolutely hellish.  It also means that once again, Ukrainian assets that are much better at deep precision fires can conduct artillery missions with much more effectiveness. I have no doubt Ukrainian counter-battery fires are wrecking Russian artillery. As soon as a Russian gun starts firing its death clock starts ticking. Yet had they permitted the Ukrainians to get deeper, they would be moment when Ukraine would self-degrade her own counter battery ability as the fight moved out of range and radars and guns had to move. Fighting close to the start lines lets Ukraine keep her assets in the fight.  Given those four assumptions, the next question is why?  Why fight forward instead of using the advantages that the prepared defenses would lend you? I have no doubt that trenches got dug, at least some obstacles were emplaced, and minefields laid but the single most important factor about a defense in depth is manpower.  By the end of WWI the trench scheme was perfected. The forward line was to break up the enemy attack and was only lightly held. The 2nd line was where you really wanted to hold, and the 3rd is where you had local reserves that could move quickly to reenforce threatened sectors and launch local counter attacks.   Behind them at some distance safe from artillery would be your operational reserves that would only be committed once you were sure you knew where the enemy's major effort was. This basic layout has not changed since 1918 because it more or less works. At Kursk the Soviets were able to use these successive lines to attrit the Germans and then at places like Prokhorovka. The Germans did it to the Soviets as well like Zhukov's defeat during Operation Mars.  Yet this style of fighting needs bodies. Look at the Battle of the Seelow Heights. Heinrici had a great defensive scheme but lacked the troops and reserves to really make it stick. He punched the Soviets in the nose but could not save Berlin. Given the size of the frontage, I think Russia is facing a manpower crisis. So let's do some math.  Russia has a maximum of 800k troops in Ukraine. She had 300,000k active-duty troops before the war. 4-50k LNR/DNR troops, 40k Wagner, a mobilization of 300k and two other induction cycles for about another 300k as well as dribs and drabs from other PMC's. Thats just about a million men. Past reports say she had committed 90% of her ground combat power to Ukraine so 900k before losses.   Now we have to consider those losses. Ukraine is claiming that number is reduced by 217k permanent losses, the US by 75k. Plus an unknown number of wounded say a traditional  3:1 ratio. If we assume half the wounded can return, but half have to be invalided out that moves the numbers up to 300k and 115k respectively.  That only leaves between 6-800k troops for the entire area. Out of that number have to come all the air defense, railway and service troops, the troops guarding Crimea, being sent to Bilhorod, used as barrier troops etc. Every cook, clerk and mechanic is one less rifleman or tanker at the front. The Russian Tooth-To-Tail ratio (T3R) is likely weighted more towards combat than NATO but is still going to be at least 1.5:1.  That reduces Russia's maximum number of troops that can fight to between 220-310K or so. Thats not very man men given the length of the front.  Thats even before we considered known concentrations like Bakhmut, Kremina, Enerhodor etc.  Take out those concentrations, and whatever is left is all Russia has to man her lines and serve as local and operational reserves.  I don't think that number is big enough to do it.  I think Russia is fighting forward to try and shock the Ukrainians into making bad assumptions about Russian strength. 'If we can beat them early, they will stop and regroup' type of thinking. I think Russia wants to fight a series of mobile battles forward where her smaller operational reserves can move around to where they are needed to act as fire brigades. This is a losing strategy.  But it may be the only option Russia has. There is one final factor that may be driving this. @oryxspioenkop has documented over 2k Russian tank losses and over 10k total pieces of significant military equipment from IFVs to guns to trucks lost so far. It is entirely possible that Russia lacks the equipment to create enough local and operational armored reserves that can afford to wait for Ukraine to come to them. Scarcity itself might be forcing Russia to go looking for Ukrainian armor to engage.   I think if Ukraine keeps on delivering blows the Russian facade will crack. I think it lacks the resources to weather the blows and when the Ukrainians get to those prepared lines, they will find them nearly devoid of troops.  My math is imperfect, but it doesn't lie. The numbers are just not there to be strong everywhere. The flipside does not hold true for Ukraine. She has 1.2-1.3 million citizens under arms. Some will be service troops, doing rear area security, guarding against Belarussian perfidy etc. but of the troops she has for combat, she can concentrate them and act where she wants to. She has the ability to achieve overwhelming local and operational superiority and has the added benefit of interior lines so shifting reserves is much easier for her.  Her biggest risk is sustainment. This is where we come in as #NAFO #Fellas... Tomorrow starts the effort to canvas all 535 members of Congress.

IF estimates of data center energy consumption turn out to be true (or even in the vicinity of truth), our current energy infrastructure will not be able to support those demands.   Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to increase energy capacity quickly.  I think it will take many solutions to solve this problem, just a few of them are:  - Off-Grid Power Generation - Nuclear - Long-Duration Energy Storage (Batteries) - Building Where the Power’s At - Grid Optimization Tech  I shared some thoughts on this in the newsletter this morning (link below).",2024-10-20T22:34:42,850,25,188

And what I mean by that is that they are sabotaging all of the mechanisms that we would normally use to figure out what's true. And that sounds like a wild exaggeration, but it isn't. The fact is it's not even just a an attack on the university system.'  'It's an attack on every single university. The research done there is low quality, not repeatable. The lessons taught there are actually, in large measure, not even true anymore. Things that are verifiably false are taught as if they are true. Our regulatory agencies work exactly in reverse.'  'They protect regulators from from citizens, not the other way around. So something is attacking all of the mechanisms in civilization that are supposed to seek the truth and act upon it, and that's not a coincidence.'   'We are now in the nightmare that Rene Descartes feared he might see in, where all of the things that he thought were were factual might not even be correct. And because our, our truth seeking apparatus has been under such intense attack, we don't know what's true. Some things that are very easy to establish.'  'It's not a difficult scientific question to figure out whether or not mRNA vaccines cause turbocancers. That's a very straightforward scientific problem, but we are nonetheless left to grapple with anecdote because to the extent that there are studies, they're likely to be set up to fail, and the rest is anecdote.'   'So we are left to make sense of the world without the most obvious basic tools, without anything that flows to us from the enlightenment, and that is indeed a very dangerous predicament.'",2025-06-05T21:20:25,0,0,1945

twitter/1859021839093440600,"Recently I started noticing that Jeffrey Sachs has a habit of making subtle distortions that he must think will go unnoticed by the average reader.  This makes me wonder who is paying him to spout this seemingly benign and well-intentioned anti-American propaganda.  For example, Sachs writes here that in his book 'The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives,' Zbigniew Brzezinski  'reached the conclusion that Russia would never form an alliance with China.  He also concluded that Russia would never form an alliance with Iran.'  This is far from the truth.  In reality, Brzezinski  writes that 'potentially, the most dangerous scenario would be a grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an 'antihegemonic' coalition united not by ideology but by complementary grievances.'  The fact that Professor Sachs has misrepresented Brzezinski casts doubt on everything else he writes.  Although he is right in highlighting that it was Gorbachev who initiated and accomplished the end of the Cold War, Sachs goes on to misrepresent  Gorbachev on the promises made to him by Secretary James Baker, which Gorbachev discusses in his interview with Maxim Korshunov, published on October 16, 2014, in Russia Beyond.  In this article, Gorbachev states that 'The topic of 'NATO expansion' was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a single Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either. Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces from the alliance would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement, mentioned in your question, was made in that context....Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done. And fulfilled. The agreement on a final settlement with Germany said that no new military structures would be created in the eastern part of the country; no additional troops would be deployed; no weapons of mass destruction would be placed there. It has been observed all these years. So don’t portray Gorbachev and the then-Soviet authorities as naïve people who were wrapped around the West’s finger.'",2024-11-20T07:52:00,65,69,15

I think I speak for most conservative women when I say that there is more to life than money. Having a child is amazing but being able to have a child and raise that child in a loving home with a present and caring father is worth more than anything money can buy. I feel for women that get the joy of motherhood without the complete bliss of raising your child with the man that you love and that loves you and yalls children more than life itself. Having a child for clout just to be a single parent is really sad and is in no way winning at life.,2025-02-15T18:47:43,1404,55,39

It’s not what the USA stands for—standing up for what’s right with complete transparency and honesty, exposing who, what, when, and where is the only path forward.  The weaponization of government isn’t new—it mirrors the greed and power plays we see in corporate America. The problem? This corruption has been entrenched for so long that it’s made politicians wealthy, binding them together in what we call the deep state and RINOs.  Their mission?

China (Xi) wants to make everything for the whole world, including chips, which is what I do for a living, but the world does not like him. Only time will tell. But my gut feel is that Xi is onto something, in an antagonistic and assiduous way. The basic idea is to dominate the world in goods therefore economy at the expense of life quality and well being of 1.4B Chinese people. Chinese people are becoming so backward these days I do not dare to share that I am from America on my trips in China.",2024-12-26T04:40:34,33,9,1

Unlike previous state bans that focused on cosmetic features of rifles, SB 3 would outlaw all semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines, including traditional hunting rifles like the Browning BAR. The bill also extends to gas-operated semiautomatic handguns with detachable magazines and semiautomatic shotguns with detachable magazines. Violations would carry severe penalties, including hefty fines and firearm possession bans for repeat offenders. Given strong legislative support, the bill is likely to pass. The controversy surrounding SB 3 highlights the growing need for Supreme Court clarification on Second Amendment rights, particularly as states continue to push the boundaries of existing rulings.",2025-02-19T05:17:00,230,31,50

In addition, asking Georgia’s Secretary of State to recalculate and just find 11,780 votes after the votes had already been counted, means that he was willing to disregard and nullify the votes of 2 million Georgians that voted for President Biden. For that reason, Georgia shouldn’t be close either.   He’s been arrested and charged with trying to overturn an election, and some of his co-defendants/former lawyers, have already pleaded guilty to the charges. Georgia shouldn’t be close for this reason as well.   Sure, he’s been able to delay the trial process. He’s done it by sadly and shamelessly attacking District Attorney Fani Willis. It’s important to remember that it was a grand jury that made the decision and found enough cause to indict the former disgraced occupant of the WH.   The citizens of Georgia deserve to know if the person that they have a chance to vote for this upcoming presidential election, is a person that was ready and willing to cancel their votes during the last election.   I say Georgia. But WE all know, it’s more than Georgia. Every state that had a fake elector scheme, and every state that was pressured to change the results of the last election shouldn’t be close and shouldn’t be in play for the former disgraced occupant of the WH. Not until it is determined if he tried to cheat the voters in those states or not.  He’s been successful in delaying. He dodging the law, but he can’t dodge the people/voters. It’s up to the people in these states, who have the power to hold him accountable. Not give him a pass because he knows how to avoid accountability and make a mockery of the justice system.   #VoteBlue2024  #DemVoice1  #ProudBlue  #Dems4Rights",2024-05-15T21:58:04,633,60,351

twitter/1906653409022779698,"So I've always put this one into the :here’s one for the “you can’t make this stuff up” file: The Adam and Eve Story by Chan Thomas was literally classified by the CIA for decades. Why? Because it doesn’t just talk about creation myths...it lays out a terrifyingly plausible theory of cyclical, civilization-resetting cataclysms. Thomas argues that every 6,500 years or so, Earth undergoes a sudden pole shift that causes massive global devastation...earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. Sound familiar? It should. It’s exactly what I’ve been saying: ancient myths, especially the flood stories, aren’t fiction. They’re memory...fractured, encoded, and repeated across time by traumatized survivors. Oh and Chan Thomas was an aerospace engineer ... let that sink a bit.   If this book was harmless speculation, why would the CIA bother slapping a classified label on it? Maybe because Thomas hit too close to the truth. Maybe because it confirms what cultures around the world have been whispering for millennia...that humanity rises, gets close to the truth, and then wham, reset. Atlantis? Wiped. Sumer? A restart. The Anunnaki send the flood, and Enki and the Oannes do damage control. This isn’t new...it’s cyclical. And those who hold power know that if the masses start realizing how many times we’ve done this dance, they might just start asking the right questions.  So yeah, do yourself a favor: go read The Adam and Eve Story; I've attached a free PDF to the bottom of the post. It’s not just a book...it’s a warning label for our species. It backs up everything we’ve been piecing together about ancient advanced civilizations, celestial intervention, and the suppressed knowledge that keeps getting buried (often literally) after every reset. If Enki and the Oannes gave us knowledge to survive the last one, maybe it’s time we actually listen.  Here it is: $URL[0]",2025-03-31T18:22:51,2045,235,378

To mark this day, my Chinese and Tibetan dissident friends @LueRuiChao @TenpaDhargyal2 recently tore up the CCP flag outside the Chinese Consulate in Perth.   Richard helpfully explained to me that this is not the national flag of China. It does not represent the Chinese nation or the Chinese people. The red of the Chinese flag represents the Chinese Communist Revolution and the five stars are supposed to represent the ''unity of four social classes of Chinese people under the Chinese Communist Party.'' It is therefore the flag of the communists who murdered 50 million Chinese under Mao and carried out genocide in Tibet. A legitimate target for protest.  Before white leftists living in the West cry and meltdown and whinge, please consider the fact that Richard and Tenpa both had to actually live under this horrible regime. Tenpa is a former political prisoner from Tibet and survived torture at the hands of the CCP. They can protest how they wish",2024-10-02T19:40:46,0,0,267

twitter/1853779733928202480,RT @Yaita_Akio: 香港歌手劉德華在台北舉辦演唱會，是昨天非常引人注目的一件事。藝術不分國界，中國或香港的歌手來台灣獻唱，當然沒有問題。但不可忽視的是，劉德華現在還有一個官方身分，是「中國電影家協會」的副主席。中國電影家協會官網上的簡介是：「中國電影家協會（簡稱中國影協）成立於1949年，是中國共產黨領導的，全國各民族電影家組成的專業性人民團體，是黨和政府聯繫電影界的橋梁和紐帶」。  可以清楚地看出，該協會並非民間組織，而是中國共產黨對國內外進行大外宣的工具之一。  眾所周知，中國的軍機和軍艦經常騷擾台灣海峽，時時刻刻在威脅著每一個台灣人的生命財產安全。現在請劉德華來台北辦演唱會，其意義，相當於烏克蘭請俄羅斯的歌手到基輔來演唱；相當於以色列請哈馬斯的歌手到特拉維夫來演唱。在國際社會看來，是非常不可思議的光景。  當然，現在也有一些台灣歌手在中國國內開演唱會。但他們演唱的內容是受到嚴格限制的。而且，這些歌手為了能夠在中國爭取到演出的機會，必須經常向中國表忠心，甚至還要表態支持中共的對台軍演。  但是，劉德華來台灣表演，內容是不受任何限制的。比如說，昨天他唱了一首歌叫「中國人」。其中有這樣的歌詞：  「五千年的風和雨啊藏了多少夢 黃色的臉黑色的眼不變是笑容 八千里山川河嶽像是一首歌 不論你來自何方將去向何處 一樣的淚 一樣的痛 曾經的苦難 我們留在心中 一樣的血 一樣的種 未來還有夢 我們一起開拓 手牽著手不分你我 昂首向前走 讓世界知道我們都是中國人」  歌詞想傳達的訊息，不是和國台辦經常對台灣進行的政治喊話「血濃於水」、「兩岸一家親」、「反對台獨」的意思差不多嗎？  國台辦最希望看到的，應該是這首歌在台灣擴大影響。從劉德華的歌迷開始擴散，最後在台灣的年輕人中廣泛傳唱起來。如果真的出現這種局面，將來說不定可以作為「認知作戰的經典案例」編入他們的課本了。,2024-11-05T20:41:44,0,0,539

twitter/1895723683374907780,"My two cents. #Zelensky literally asked for it. When he walked into the Oval Office as a guest of President Trump, one assumed that he had read the room properly. There was no need for him to ventilate his views on Russia, and President Putin when the world knows where Ukraine stands on these issues and how it has been affected. He should’ve said that he was in Washington to help forge an end to the conflict, to bring peace to the people of Ukraine, and that the active involvement and support of the United States in this process was critical, was crucial, was fundamental and that Ukraine would always be grateful for that. Behind closed doors, diplomacy can be transacted in a much more frank and candid way, and Ukraine could have laid out its position with unvarnished clarity before the Americans. That would have definitely been a way to build common ground and reduce differences. The point is that Zelensky completely forgot, or chose to forget, his lines in the Oval Office before the media. It was the worst performance imaginable because it did incalculable damage to Ukraine’s interests. Moscow must be gloating . Zelensky showed that he is glutton for punishment when he began grandstanding ignoring that he has very few cards and there is so much at stake for his country. Lastly, I don’t see why he could not have worn a suit. No harm in ‘showing’ respect for a very important diplomatic event by dressing appropriately for it if it will go down well with your hosts and helps you minimalize small irritants without any loss of face.",2025-03-01T14:32:01,1053,163,207

twitter/1833122472952209761,私は小泉進次郎さんを応援します。  先日の旭区内で行った時局講演会や、一部の報道の取材でもすでに申し上げておりますが、小泉進次郎さんが覚悟を持って立候補を正式に表明しましたので、私も全力で応援したいと思います。  今回の総裁選挙では、 「自民党を変え、政治改革を断行し、政治に信頼を取り戻す」 ことが問われています。  国民のための政策を実行しようとしても、政治に対して国民の皆様の信頼が無ければ、スピード感を持って政策を前に進めることはできないからです。  「改革に終わりなし。」  真の政治改革とは政治透明化改革です。 カネやポストの「派閥政治」のしがらみに捉われることがない小泉進次郎さんなら、政治とカネの不透明な流れを断ち切り、政策活動費の廃止や旧文通費の使途を公開するなど、政治改革を断行し、政治に信頼を取り戻すことができると思います。  小泉進次郎さんは、43歳。 若い力で閉塞感漂う日本の空気を一緒になって変えたいと思います。駅頭をしている中で、若いとか、経験が不足しているとか、心配のお声をいただくことも確かに事実です。しかし、衆議院議員を閣僚経験も含め約15年間務めていることは、決して経験不足とも言えません。  フランスのマクロン大統領は39歳の時に当選、アメリカの共和党副大統領候補に指名されたヴァンス氏は39歳。世界の若いリーダーは、十分に活躍しています。  今回の総裁選挙は自民党が再生して、「新生自民党」となれるかどうかが問われています。  そして自民党の構造的な問題であった「派閥政治」が完全ではないにしろ、大半がなくなった状態で迎える初めての総裁選です。今後の各総裁候補との論戦にも小泉進次郎さんの発言に注目していただきたいと思います。  小泉進次郎さんは、第二子が生まれて間もない中、覚悟を持って日本のために総裁選挙の立候補を決意されました。 自民党神奈川県連会長として、地方議員の声を真面目に聞いている姿や国会で真剣に議論している姿を間近に見て、時には議員会館で憲法改正や日本の将来について真剣に語り合い、この方なら自民党を変え、我が国の閉塞感を打ち破ることができる方だと確信しました。  小泉進次郎さんと共に総裁選挙を戦います。小泉進次郎さんをよろしくお願い申し上げます。,2024-09-09T20:37:09,238,230,16

twitter/1819114367012818966,"🇩🇿🇫🇷 | Clarification on Imane Khelif:  Imane Khelif has XY chromosomes and a congenital issue with penis development. Assigned female at birth and raised as a girl, she likely only became aware of her condition around puberty. Despite this, she is not insensitive to testosterone and has experienced male puberty.  She is not a 'classic' male but an intersex individual leaning towards male characteristics due to her chromosomes. While she has a form of vagina from birth, her physical traits align more with male characteristics outside of genitalia.  Testosterone is considered a performance-enhancing substance for women, placing her case in a unique category (not a transgender issue). World Championships had disqualified her, but the Olympics have more lenient rules. This situation raises questions about fairness in women's categories, as her case is ethically ambiguous.  Socially, she is recognized as female, but biologically, apart from the penis, she exhibits male traits. She lacks a uterus and ovaries but has undescended testicles.  The Olympics consider her socially female, as she has always competed as a woman. She likely uses testosterone blockers but retains male-associated physical advantages, such as enhanced lung capacity, bones, and muscles, which can be significant in boxing.

twitter/1718096167685202028,每一天我们几乎总能听到看到有关死亡的新闻，而每一次的死亡往往又来得如此突然而意外，让人猝不及防。  昨天一位特别的人物猝然离去，有关他生前的照片和语录几乎刷了屏。我也读到了他曾经留下的这样一条哲理名句： “纯真而不欠闻达，善良而不失坚强，把生命高举在尘俗之上，又溶化于社会之中，这应当是我们这一代人的共同追求。”  每一个有关死亡的事件，都在提醒我们，死是每个人的结局。所以，我们需要正视死亡，思考死亡。无论大人物还是小人物，无论高贵还是卑贱，无论有权还是无权，每个人在死亡面前是绝对平等的，没有任何例外。  唯独死亡，消除了人间一切的等级和差别。对于大人物来说，死亡无情地剥夺了他们曾经享有的财富、荣华、权势和地位，让这一切全部化为了幻影……  面对死亡，我们还能说什么呢？很多时候人们期待“来日方长” ，但死亡却把世界残酷的一面摆在我们面前，让我们直面生命的本相。因为“凡有血气的，尽都如草，他的美荣都像草上的花。草必枯干，花必凋谢。”（圣经彼得前书1:24）  “来日方长”不过是一场幻影，明天到底如何，我们并不晓得；至于何时死亡、以什么方式离去，更是无人掌控。正如古希伯来的智者所罗门所说：“无人有权力掌管生命，将生命留住；也无人有权力掌管死期；这场争战，无人能免……”（圣经传道书8:8）。  一般的中国人非常忌讳谈“死”，进而对和“死”有关的谐音都唯恐避之不及，生怕沾染晦气。但，这并不是一个健康的态度。还有很多人面对无法躲避的死亡时，又陷入一种迷信，他们信奉的是“早死早超生”的哲学。虽然他们不相信死亡是生命的终点，但他们却说，死亡不过是落入另一个轮回里，还有“超脱”的机会。这才是“精神鸦片”！  死亡既不是生命的终点，也不是进入无休止的轮回。如果死亡就是生命的终点，那才是最为残忍的事情，也是真正的绝望。如果死亡只是不停的进入一个又一个轮回，那真叫折腾，依然没有超越，没有盼望。  尽管人生充满虚空和苦痛，但我们可以通过信心的仰望，可以把自己的生命高举在这个“尘俗世界”之上，连于那生命活水的源头。  所以，每个信靠基督的人可以向死亡夸胜，向永恒瞻望。对他们来说，死亡不是生命的结束，而是通往永恒的一个中转站，那是打开了一道盼望之门。  只有明白了死亡的这个奥秘，我们才能更好地活着，去有意义和有价值地生活。,2023-10-28T10:43:41,29,2,7

The FBI found no evidence of a coordinated plan to overthrow the government on January 6th.  2. Trump’s speech explicitly called for peaceful protest: “patriotically and peacefully make your voices heard.”  3. Not a single person has been convicted of “insurrection” because the evidence doesn’t exist.  4. Congress reconvened just hours after the breach to certify the election, proving the system worked.  5. Pelosi rejected Trump’s offer of 20,000 National Guard troops to secure the Capitol days before January 6th.  6. Capitol Police opened doors and escorted protesters inside hardly the hallmark of a coup.  7. The only person killed directly during the event was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed veteran, shot by Capitol Police.  8. Officer Brian Sicknick’s death was falsely attributed to the riot he died of natural causes the next day.  9. Most charges against January 6th participants were for trespassing, not violent crimes.  10. The real assault on democracy is the weaponization of January 6th to silence political dissent.  January 6, 2021, isn’t living in infamy because of Trump it’s being exploited as a political weapon.

The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group primarily residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China. Here are some key points based on available information:  - **Xinjiang Region**: The Uyghurs are indigenous to Xinjiang, which has been historically and geographically referred to as East Turkestan. This area has been under Chinese control since the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, but tensions have escalated over time, particularly in recent decades.  - **Suppression Methods**: Various reports and analyses have highlighted that the Chinese government has employed a range of tactics to suppress Uyghur culture and religion:   - **Internment Camps**: There have been widespread reports of mass detentions in what the Chinese government terms 'vocational education and training centers' but are often described by international observers as internment or re-education camps. Estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands to over a million Uyghurs have been detained without due process since 2017.   - **Surveillance and Control**: Uyghurs face extensive surveillance, including facial recognition technology, DNA collection, and restrictions on movement through numerous checkpoints. They are also subjected to cultural and religious suppression, such as restrictions on fasting during Ramadan, bans on certain religious practices, and the demolition or alteration of mosques.   - **Forced Assimilation**: There are accusations of forced assimilation into Han Chinese culture, including through the 'Sinicization' of Islam, where mosques are modified to look less Islamic and more in line with Chinese architectural styles.  - **International Response**: The treatment of Uyghurs has been labeled by some countries and organizations as genocide, crimes against humanity, or both. The U.S. government, for instance, has officially declared the actions against Uyghurs as genocide, while organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented abuses that they argue constitute crimes against humanity.  - **Cultural and Religious Erasure**: The suppression extends to cultural practices, language use, and religious activities, with the aim to assimilate Uyghurs into the dominant Han Chinese culture, often under the guise of counter-terrorism measures.",2025-02-13T09:34:44,16,15,2

Qu Jing, Baidu’s VP of PR, made controversial and out-of-touch remarks, sparking a public outcry in China. Her insensitive comments included disregard for employees’ family circumstances and threats of professional retaliation. These videos went viral—which she posted at will on her social media— led to a broader discussion on the appropriateness of her behavior and its reflection on Baidu's corporate culture on the Chinese internet.  This incident caused Baidu's stock prices to tumble and raised questions about the impact of executives' personal brands on their companies. She also mentioned receiving hundreds of complaint letters from her colleagues, which she dismissed as slanderous. She threatened to ruin the careers of those who complained.  Fun fact:  a Baidu headhunter recently approached me for an International PR Director role for AI, reporting directly to this Baidu VP. This VP doesn’t speak English, so she wants to hire someone fluent in Mandarin, not a white person (Ivy: this was verbatim), based overseas but will move back to China.   The VP will manage Baidu’s global AI communications portfolio with the help of this new hire. The job description was fascinating and included language like:   “Elevate the company’s strategic business and executives’ thought leadership to secure positive coverage in top-tier foreign media. Strive for positive comments with global influence to create ‘ammunition’ for repurposing in China-based content distribution.”  Of the few brief exchanges, there were red flags all around. But Baidu, since you might need a new PR or some crisis control services now😂, call me maybe🎶.  Reputation management rule #1: All external-facing communication matters.

twitter/1886177268352815245,"I wish this latest round of bed-wetting from Andrew Coyne came as more of a surprise. But anyone afraid of annexation is suffering from an acute and irrational phobia best treated by spending less time on social media.  I've never opined on 'the wisdom of Trump's strategic vision for us.' Not least because he doesn't have a strategic vision for us, he's focused on his own country's strategy. My comments are largely on what Canada's response should be in light of the sobering economic correlation of forces. US exports to Canada represent 1.5% of US GDP. Canadian exports to the US are 20% of our GDP. US exports to Canada could go to zero, and while some northern states would be hit pretty hard, it wouldn't even slow the US economy enough to trigger a recession. On the other hand, if Canadian exports to the US went to zero, it would be a cataclysm.  As a fervent flag-waiving patriot and enthusiastic member of Team Canada, I'm afraid the tough-talk and posturing is not going to cut it. Unilateral insistence that we are entitled to the status quo simply because we've gotten accustomed to it, while refusing to negotiate with Trump because we purport to possess the moral high ground, instead, puffing out our maple leaf emblazoned chests in defiance of the 'bad orange bully,' is dim-witted bunk (Andrew Coyne's apparent stock-in-trade).  If someone in the beleaguered Liberal cabinet, with the authority to do so, called up the president and proposed two simple things, I suspect the trade war would end overnight.  Firstly, a modest earmark for stronger and collaborative border security measures (which would both satisfy Trump and redound to our benefit—see the Toronto police's seizure of 900kg of cocaine two weeks ago, smuggled over the US border, and note the vast majority of illegal firearms on Canadian streets come over the US border).  Secondly, make good on our long-overdue commitment as a member of NATO to contribute 3% of GDP to defense. Something we should be doing for decades.  That's it. My prediction is those two mutually beneficial 'concessions' with a bit of finesse would be enough to resolve the issue overnight.  In my personal experience with Donald Trump, he is a tough negotiator, but I have never known him to reject a fair deal.   As a hedge against his supposed unpredictability, by all means respond with counter tariffs, but that's not a fight we can win. The only real counterpunch, such as there is one, is a combination of heeding Premier Danielle Smith's call to fast track domestic oil and gas pipelines, construct LNG terminals on each coast, and unshackle Canada's resource economy, while getting busy strengthening existing and developing new international trade relationships (CANZUK for starters). Unfortunately, it appears the Liberal government is gearing up to walk the plank, while Andrew Coyne cheers them on.",2025-02-03T06:17:58,4539,680,1375

twitter/1906847998539092102,"MEET DICK DURBIN  Durbin did his undergraduate & law degrees at Georgetown, one of the Ivy League-adjacent schools. That should give you an indication of why he's so condescending, he thinks he's special.  If you look at his work history, it's made to look like he had his own law practice. Sure, he probably had an office, and a sign, and an administrator, but it looks like it was simply a stage prop to make it look like he was working while grifting & trying to get elected. It doesn't look like he created any jobs, built a law practice, or made his own way.  He got his law degree in 1969 and immediately became legal counsel to Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon from 1969 to 1972, and then legal counsel to the Illinois State Senate Judiciary Committee from 1972 to 1982. All of this with absolutely no other practical legal experience. Doesn't that seem very odd?  So, he was a paid staffer from 1969-1982 while during this time:  • Durbin ran for the Illinois State Senate in 1976 and lost. • Durbin ran for lieutenant governor in 1978 and lost.  See how this works? He gets paid as a staffer by someone else, in this case Paul Simon & the Illinois State Senate Judiciary Committee, paid with taxpayer money, while he campaigns for office.  He finally won an election in 1982 & went to the US House of Representatives. The rest is career politician history.  Durbin's wife was a lobbyist, and it was reported by the Chicago Tribune in 2014 that some of her 'clients have received federal funding promoted by [Durbin]'. In addition to announcing the award of monies to ten clients of his wife's lobbying firm, these conflicts included her lobbying firm receiving a one-year contract with a housing nonprofit group around the time Durbin went to bat for the organization; a state university receiving funds through an earmark by Durbin when his wife was its lobbyist; and Durbin arranging federal money for a public health nonprofit when his wife was seeking state support for the same group.  All of these have to be 'coincidences' because the Durbins maintain that they try to avoid conflicts of interest.  Dick Durbin is a grifter & a fraud. Always was, always will be.",2025-04-01T07:16:05,7,1,3

While it's essential for women who aren't financially independent, it's becoming widely misused today.  According to Indian law, a woman can request alimony even if she's earning, which means a man could end up paying maintenance after a divorce, continuing to support her financially.  The courts seem to hold men responsible for earning and providing for women, even after separation.  This raises an interesting question: if men are expected to earn and provide, shouldn't they be able to ask for alimony for cooking and house chores in return?",2025-03-06T12:59:56,0,0,15

twitter/1802474745222611004,許多中文世界學者、業餘學術愛好者愛以找西方漢學家對史料的誤讀為職志，這完全是正常的學術行為，但以中文為母語者做出離譜的解釋者，也相當之多。只是，大部分的中文母語者，可以直接在文中引一大段文言文原文，而不加解釋，好似讀懂文言文為常識一般。但外語的著作沒辦法這樣搞，漢學家就算想要大段引用原始史料，也必須親自翻譯。所以，基本上這是結構性的問題。於此結構之中，中文世界學者擁有得天獨厚的優勢，可以將自己的誤讀，隱藏在大段原文之中。可是，以外語來寫中國史的學者卻無法。最膚淺的層次來看，此乃外國學者之大劣勢，但由於我現在也主要用英文寫作，反而我覺得這不是劣勢，而是好到無以復加的優勢，因為此舉迫使人將自己心裡的解釋，用人能看懂的方式，表達出來。所以我也嘗試在YouTube頻道裡，用白話文翻譯文言文。  一來，一般中文世界的人聽到文言文，耳朵就自動閉起來、或是腦袋就停止停機。決非因為笨或不努力，而是文言文已經離現實的生活，太遙遠了。二來，此舉也強迫我真誠地揭露自己對史料的理解。很有可能，我的白話文解釋是錯的，但不自知，所以如果有哪位有識之士見到我的錯，能替我指出來，對我而言是巨大的好處。  雖說如此，我依然認為誤讀不是什麼大問題。試以康有為的《新學偽經考》為例。此書出於1891年，若我的記憶無誤，此書一出，便在中國學術界引起轟動。清廷應該是禁了此書兩回。其中，康氏最大的論斷莫若全書開頭的一段話：”始作偽亂聖制者自劉歆，布行偽經篡孔統者成于鄭玄。閱二千年歲、月、日、時之綿曖，聚百、千、萬、億衿纓之問學，統二十朝王者禮樂制度之崇嚴，咸奉偽經為聖法，誦讀尊信，奉持施行，違者以非聖無法論，亦無一人敢違者，亦無一人敢疑者。于是奪孔子之經以與周公，而抑孔子為傳；于是掃孔子改制之聖法，而目為斷爛朝報。”  什麼意思？意思是，康有為認為兩千年來中國人以為的”古學”、”古文經”，其實都是”新學”，乃西漢末年劉歆偽造的，後來又被東漢另外一位大儒鄭玄給強化、散佈出去。康有為主張，孔子之學的真正精神是”改制”，但該精神在”古文經”學派之中，卻無影無蹤。康有為主張，兩千年來儒者所奉為圭臬、經者，全是偽造的。  在經歷過社會主義、後現代主義洗禮的現代人，不假思索便會說，這是假的、說這是康氏為其政治目的而說的。終極而言，很可能就是如此，但如同人最終都會死一樣，但你會說所有人都是死人嗎？  實際上，康有為是在晚清那樣的政治、文化環境之中，用其有限能接觸到的材料，所炒出的一盤新菜。無論你喜不喜歡，甚至看不起他的私生活，康有為對儒學的誤讀/新詮釋，都影響了一代人。錢穆這樣沒有中學學歷的人，之所以後來能成為北京大學的正教授，就是站在康有為引發的今古文經浪潮之上。錢賓四說其年輕時，每天看的報紙、周刊，都在討論今古文經問題，他看完全部的討論，然後不同意所有人的看法，因而一邊當中學教員，一邊開始起草《先秦諸子繫年》的稿子。後來，錢穆也因為這部著作，累積起名聲，有了許多紛絲。顧頡剛就是其中一個錢穆。當顧頡剛讀了《先秦諸子繫年》後，就直接問錢穆要不要到大學任教。  往後，直接針對康有為的《新學偽經考》，錢穆動筆寫《劉向歆父子年譜》，書成後在當時的北平學術界，引起大轟動，推翻了上述康有為的論點。然而，如果沒有康有為在十九世紀末的一次”誤讀”的話，民初、乃至今日的學術，可能就會成為另一個樣子。前面提到錢穆的伯樂，顧頡剛，他在民初引發的古史辨運動，也受到康有為《新學偽經考》莫大的啟發。隨便去翻一番顧頡剛日記，可以看到顧氏其實一直都在讀《偽經考》，有事沒事就拿出來點校一下。錢穆剛到燕京大學的時候，問顧頡剛為什麼他還要引用康有為的著作，顧頡剛想了想，回答說因為我那時候還沒讀過你的書。  所以，”誤讀”是個很值得琢磨的事件。如同非洲上一隻那麼小的蝴蝶，擺了擺翅膀，卻在遙遠的南美洲掀起巨大龍捲風。,2024-06-17T06:54:02,14,0,3

twitter/1889902737141407870,"Checked in on @ChannelNewsAsia's YouTube channel again today. Found some shocking/depressing info while clicking around - more on that at the end of this tweet. But first: CNA's subtle PR for the US continues in the form of Global South smears and lying by omission about the US.   Take CNA's second most recently posted video for instance. It's about 'rising global military spending' (IISS annual military report indicates global defence spending is hitting new heights - $URL[0]  Somehow or other, CNA does not mention US military-spending/production *at all* in the video, despite the US increasing spending in 2024 to an amount greater than the next 10 countries combined, and producing arms for Israel and Ukraine.  Of course, CNA manages to mention China, Russia, Iran and North Korea's military-spending/production - in a fearmongering manner - despite most of these countries not being involved in foreign wars and only building up for defence.  So CNA's PR for the US continues with smearing of the Global South and lying by omission about the US.   As for the shock, I decided to check up on IISS' funding - I've checked before, IISS is an Anglo 'think tank' based in the US, UK and Singapore. They are funded by the western military industrial complex, including companies like BAE, Lockheed Martin, as well as western militaries like the British army.  Here's the shocker: for the first time, I noticed @mindefsg, @Temasek and ST Engineering amongst the orgs that fund IISS. Yes you read that right, @govsingapore linked orgs are funding an Anglo 'think tank' that has a transparent anti-Global-South slant.  I know some think the Singapore government/elites are 'neutral' and 'trying to balance relations'. If our media/academia's pro-US slant wasn't enough to convince you that they aren't in fact neutral, I think this funding of IISS should go some way.  $URL[1]",2025-02-13T13:01:39,85,11,19

twitter/1644669144107827201,"Back in the 80s I ran many missions during my years in the US Coast Guard, but the one that still haunts me to this day was the search for a missing vessel in the Gulf of Mexico.  When we located the vessel, we found a woman who had been raped repeatedly by the two men who owned the vessel - men who were about to murder her.  Fortunately we arrived in time and saved her.  I FEEL THIS SAME SENSE OF “DUTY TO PROTECT” WHEN I HEAR ABOUT WHAT TRANS WOMEN (AKA MEN) ARE DOING TO REAL WOMEN.  What just happened to swimmer Riley Gaines gets me riled up for 2 reasons.  1- People born as Men are being allowed to attack women.  2-People born as Men are being allowed to SILENCE THE FREE SPEECH of women.  I have 5 sisters and a wife & daughter, and I know that if the TRANS MENACE ever affected them in any harmful way, I’d be ready to strap up and go to war for them.  Fellas, apparently women and girls can’t complain about having to share their bathrooms and locker rooms with naked men.  They can’t refuse to compete against a biological male without social repercussions.  They can’t defeat these “trans women” in a fight - because TRANS WOMEN ARE STILL PHYSICALLY MEN!  AND SO WE MUST SPEAK UP FOR THE WOMEN WHO CAN’T SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.  You know why the TRANS MENACE only affects women?  Because MEN won’t tolerate it.  REAL MEN don’t care what your pronouns are.  REAL MEN don’t care about “misgendering” you.  REAL MEN KNOW that if you’re calling yourself a trans woman, you’re really a man.  AND A REAL MAN WILL FIGHT ANOTHER MAN IN DEFENSE OF THE WOMEN HE LOVES!  So let’s go men. Let’s “join the conversation” against trans rights that cancel, diminish or harm women.  Let’s show these dudes that they have NO RIGHTS to harm our women or our children!  We’re Ameri-CAN, not Ameri-can’t.  AND WE CAN DO THIS!  God Bless America 🇺🇸",2023-04-08T19:50:55,29120,1584,6986

twitter/1899489618430402939,"Good re-connecting with my former podcast colleague @DrJBhattacharya in DC.   While watching Jay live in the Senate, I was pleased to see him reaffirm the one quality which I found most striking in our podcast collaboration together: his commitment to platforming and encouraging alternate, dissident viewpoints. This goes against human nature on some fundamental level so it is hard to do. People often prefer comfortable like-mindedness over vigorous debate and challenging of their ideas. Monolithic thinking takes precedent over diversity of opinion - especially at legacy institutions like NIH and FDA.  He’s been consistent on this from the launch of our podcast in 2023 (and well before that) to the Senate hearing last week where he emphatically asserted this. Science has a tendency to be too conservative and not take new, bold risks. This will now be actively encouraged.  The NIH will be served well by Jay’s high-minded vision.",2025-03-11T23:56:30,140,6,17

Weichert's shared article within this post, also makes clear that there is continuing need to end all Lobbyists to Congress. Get rid of the building across the street and the Lobbyists within, so that Congress members don't cross the street to do business not permitted in the Halls of Congress. If it's not permitted in Congress, then the members should not be doing that business, at all.  When the DoD's abiding defense contracts are going to Boeing-Lockheed-Martin and others, the extreme bias in these selections is clear. It is Lobbyist based and needs to stop, in order to give the start-up's like Elon Musk's SpaceX the level opportunity due all Americans. If Lady Justice is blindfolded to give equal lateral justice to all, then that justice begins by not having lobbyists influencing US Lawmakers in Congress, writing the Bills for Congressional members, and paying into the system to influence the outcome of US laws, contracts, and infrastructure. Congress must end the all business with Lobbyists to provide a level opportunity to Americas people. The fact that SpaceX has made it, in the midst of such adverse wrong intentional bias, lobbying, and legal tactics to stop SpaceX, is truly an amazing uphill story of Capitalist success in America.",2024-10-15T22:36:45,4,1,1

He is a righteous man with a lot of faults just like the rest of us. You're not going to find anyone that loves this country more than President Trump. He gave us our country back in 2016.

Trump knows how to keep them in check, but with Biden-Harris, they do whatever they please.  Biden took showers with his daughter (documented in her diary) and touched little girls inappropriately (on videotape).

twitter/1844624314269634638,特斯拉在10/10發表了一些新產品，有些很快可以上市，有些比較接近概念，剛看完的時候，有點反高潮的感覺，「就這樣？」既沒有確切的上市日期，也沒有預期外的科技。但再看更多的現場試用影片，感覺就不一樣了。我認為，沒有一個汽車公司和特斯拉可以同日而語，更精準的說，特斯拉已經不能算汽車公司了。  明年，特斯拉就會在加州和德州，進行無人計程車的試驗，一如谷歌的Waymo，但用的車還不是新品的Cybercab，Cybercab要2026年後才會生產，所以會先用Model 3和Model Y試行。但從Cybercab在華納片場的現場試坐來看，特斯拉進行的，應該會是像Waymo一樣，有geofence，車子會在確定的路線裡面跑，不會有意料之外的行程和狀況。但一看整個螢幕和車內的設計，就知道豐田、寶馬這些車廠比不過了。特斯拉的軟硬體整合，原本就在這些傳統車廠之上，而特斯拉能請到的軟體工程師，是蘋果、谷歌等級的一流，不是傳統車廠可以望其項背，這些傳統車廠，既沒有股票，也沒有相應的文化，再強的軟體工程師，進去都是死路一條。  而傳統車廠原本領先的設計和製造能力，特斯拉不但趕上，還超越，因為特斯拉沒有包袱，沒有需要顧及「車子就該怎麼設計」的僵固文化，也可以從頭思考製造的流程及科技的使用，所以各方面看來，特斯拉都沒有對手。但在賣車子領先，沒有太多的市場價值。豐田一年賣一千萬輛車，遠遠超過特斯拉的一百多萬，但市值還比不上特斯拉，特斯拉的市值上漲，要靠別的市場，不是車子。這就是無人計程車的重要所在了。  無人計程車改變的，不是只有車市，也不是只有計程車市場，改變的是整個城市的建設。馬斯克提到的是Parking Lot變成Park，因為車子不用再停在定點，不需要佔去大量都市空間的停車場。通勤會變成一個享受的時光，而不是浪費的時間。這些都會是商機。以後小孩上、下學，不用家長接送，家裡的無人Cybercab，隨叫隨到，既安全又便捷。一台不到三萬美元，有錢一點的人，都可以買上幾台使用。  面對日益擁擠的城市交通，日本、歐洲的軌道建設完敗美國的高速公路，但無人計程車的到來，就會逆轉這個走勢。只要無人計程車變成唯一允許的交通工具，不但安全性百分百，而且路面使用效率提到數倍，又不用建設費用高昂的軌道系統，洛杉磯的公路，反而變成最方便的路網。特斯拉這次還推出概念性的Robovan，可以載十五人的小巴，有這樣舒服又便宜的乘坐系統，地鐵、巴士，如何比得上？  我認為有些比較開明，有先進思想的小型城市，也許會張開雙手擁抱無人計程車，全面禁止人類開車，完全自動駕駛，全面改變都市的設計。一旦有這樣未來的城市出現，人們就會相信無人自駕車的未來，而逐步接受無人車。馬斯克打算帶給人類這樣的未來，而在他的未來藍圖裡，還有兩步大棋。一步就是今天出來的機器人，短短幾年內，特斯拉開發的機器人，已經可以算是全世界最先進的，不但可以調酒，還可以與人對話，玩猜拳。馬斯克說，機器人會變成全世界賣的最好的產品，八十億人，需要的不只是八十億個機器人。如果機器人可以做家事、照顧小孩、貓狗，那我就算借錢也要買個幾台來用。這個未來，也許會來得比我們想像的更快。  另一個未來，就比較抽象了。所有特斯拉的車，都會超出需要的配備硬體，尤其是電腦。馬斯克說，這些電腦，大部份時間都是閒置的，算力是浪費了。特斯拉以後會有一個運算力的網路，運用這些閒罝的電腦。至於，算力要用在什麼，那就不是我可以想像的了。  特斯拉短期的股票表現會如何，我不知道，但我知道，不要懷疑馬斯克。特斯拉很可能是全世界第一個市值10 trillion的公司。,2024-10-11T14:21:22,212,16,29
twitter/1866167069684683017,「如果亞裔少一點，亞洲移民少一點，美國會比較好」，聽到這話，亞裔大概就要滿頭發熱，不是對號入座，頭低下來，接受這個美國主流社會的歧視，就是義勇衝鋒，要把講這話的種族主義者給轟下台。先別忙，講這話的是賓大法學院的Amy Wax教授，她正因為這樣的發言，被學校停薪中。故事有很多層面，讓我花一些篇幅討論一下。  Amy Wax是紐約長大的猶太裔，聰明過人，在耶魯大學以最高榮譽畢業後，先在牛津拿了個三主修碩士，接著到哈佛，同時就學醫學院和法學院。她先拿到醫學博士，接著在紐約知名的康乃爾醫院受住院醫師訓練，一邊當醫生，一邊到哥倫比亞唸完她的法學院。在以34歲「高龄」拿到法學博士後，Wax棄醫從法，當上律師，當上法學教授，而在2001年開始到賓大當正教授。  Amy Wax受到全國矚目，最主要的原因是她在2017年，講了「大逆不道」的話。她說，「拿賓大法學院，或者是其它前十名的法學院來說。有一些『不方便」的事實，我沒有看過一個黑人學生畢業成績在前四分之一，很少很少在前半段。我只能記得一個或是兩個黑人，在我教的第一年必修，成績在前半段。」這個事實很「不方便」，因為2017年，正是DEI正要以新的政治正確開始改造社會，開始要以黑人始終在社會受到白人歧視的理由，要修理白人至上主義，要無限制地提高黑人地位。所以Amy Wax得死，至少是社會死亡，得被取消。但Wax既沒有說謊，又有終身職保護，學校拿不出反駁的證據，只能逼她不准教一年級的必修課。  黑人學術成績不好，眾所周知，有許多的原因，值得探討，但因為進步左派的affirmative action，把黑人近乎用保障名額的方式，拉拔到了許多高等學術的殿堂，導致了學術界黑人水準普遍不夠的問題。哈佛前校長Claudine Gay，被發現學術抄襲而被逼下台，但我們學經濟的，看她的著作，早就知道她不到一流學者的地步，只因為左派喜歡看她「什麼都符合」的背景，硬拉到一個她根本不夠格的地位。這個affirmative action對黑人的傷害，遠超過一般人的想像。當你在美國看醫生，你看到醫生是黑人，你一定要小心，因為affirmative action加上DEI，製造出了醫界的二等公民，他們從小的學術要求就不比亞裔高，現在又沒人敢要求他們，所以懂的人，都知道要躲開黑人醫生。但這對有實力的黑人來說，是不公平的，就算他們憑自己的實力唸上了哈佛醫學院，世人還是認定他們是不夠格的，這就是affirmative action傷害所有人的原因。  Amy Wax也許是個自大的猶太人，但她這裡講的話，不是種族主義，她講的是美國文化的向下沉淪，這也和affirmative action、DEI這些風潮有關。Wax認為，美國有些次文化，違反主流價值，對美國社會是不好的。這些次文化，比如說大城市裡的黑人文化，不鼓勵努力、不支持讀書、不敬天愛人、認定社會都是欠他們的，稍為上進一點的黑人，就會被同儕說acting white「裝白」而被排擠，這樣的背景，造成黑人學業準備嚴重不足，也是她在學校看不到成績好的黑人的原因。 Amy Wax避開了James D. Watson一樣的種族論，所以她沒有被真正的取消。有興趣的話，可以去查一下Watson這個諾貝爾獎得主怎麼被取消的故事。  Wax的文化論，也是她講開頭那段話的原因。她的全文是，「如果大多數的亞裔都一直支持民主黨，並提倡他們的主張，那亞裔少一點，亞洲移民少一點的話，美國會比較好。」她的出發點是亞裔讓人費解，明明民主黨的主張，都和亞裔傳統價值相違背，為什麼亞裔主流還是支持民主黨，是因為「亞裔想要討好菁英，還是太專注在自我提升，還是有服從性、奴性，還是缺乏後啟蒙思想的認知，還是對集中權力的軟弱，還是對自由的不置可否，還是缺乏有思考深度和勇敢有個人主義，亦或是對強勢、無腦的社會工程過度的包容？」  好了，除了基因外，Amy Wax把所有亞裔不能自我思考而猛投民主黨的原因都寫出來了，投民主黨的讀者諸君，你是哪一種？  我當然知道文化對一個人的成長和思想的養成，有極大的關係，但文化論有一個致命的缺點，那就是把人當成文化的產物，而不是獨立的個體。杭亭頓的文化論，現在多半已被駁斥，但他的理論正是和Amy Wax如出一轍。杭亭頓的政治理論最失敗的就是說文化的相近，會促進政治的統合，所以台灣最終會和中國走在一起，而烏克蘭也會是大俄羅斯文化圈的一部份。但我們現在知道，人的價值，遠超過所謂的「同文同種」文化、血緣論。台灣人的追求自我獨立、民主自由，讓台灣和中國越走越遠，這是杭亭頓無法想像的結果。同樣的Amy Wax描述的「左派亞裔」，也像是文化一樣，只是亞裔在美國的價值體系的一部份，不但不是全部，而且可能是日漸縮小的一部份。證據在於這次的總統大選，亞裔的向右轉，趨勢相當明顯。到頭來，亞裔要在美國社會生存、出人頭地，要擁抱的，還是美國自由民主社會的核心價值，而不是民主黨的綁架式洗腦。  這個自由民主社會的核心價值，一直是美國中道的價值，也是一直會把美國極端左右政治往回拉的力量。這些價值是什麼呢？「努力就能成功，誠實正直路才能走得長遠，照顧家庭、關注鄰里、推己及人可以滿足人的社群渴望，敬畏上天、相信獎善罰惡是道德的基礎，自我責任的要求是民主社會運行的基本，愛國並且熱愛自由是身為美國人的基本責任。」美國的社會價值，對亞裔移民來說，一點都不難了解，一點都不窒礙難行，因為這也是我們大部份的人成長所接受的價值！  所以Amy Wax搞錯了，越多的亞裔，才越能保護美國的傳統價值，一如開國的英格蘭、蘇格蘭移民，後來的德國移民，再後來的愛爾蘭、義大利和猶太移民一樣，只要接受美國價值，就是好移民。,2024-12-10T01:04:35,228,12,52

You can drive almost any direction and find water (as much as you need) and bathroom supplies, snacks, food, so many things! FEMA is everywhere.

I’d imagine some farms lost their hay and the animals need it. They really seem to be thinking of everything.

twitter/1781529337910714576,"A great number of Chinese internet users have commented on the Israeli embassy's Douyin account with the same message: 'I have never seen such a person who has no shame.'(Picture 1 and 2)  Chinese social media users often use the expression 'I have never seen such a person who has no shame' in their online conversations. The phrase originated in a 1994 television rendition of the 14th-century historical novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' one of China's Four Great Classical Novels.   In the TV show, Zhuge Liang (诸葛亮), the Shuhan state's imperial chancellor, and Wang Lang (王朗), the Caowei state's minister, had a heated dispute. Zhuge chastised Wang, saying he had never seen such a person without shame, and Wang fell off his horse and died on the spot as a result of the shame.  The TV show scene was later turned into a meme, which Chinese internet users have used to express disapproval and distrust (Picture 3).",2024-04-20T11:44:28,439,13,76

The PLA is affectionately called 'our most beloved ones' by the people, and veterans and soldiers are honoured for protecting the people and country. They are granted advantages like discounted tickets to tourist spots, although they rarely use them and instead stand in line like everyone else.  Many Westerners find it hard to believe when they visit China for the first time, but the Chinese have a strong trust in our PLA soldiers and police, and the relationship between the people and the PLA is highly cordial.",2024-12-24T15:34:36,2073,55,288

twitter/1822716370859204894,"FIVE simple things Trump could announce that would appeal to the CENTER and even many LEFTISTS (and that Kamala couldn’t copy): 1) End all personal income taxes forever. Let American workers keep what they earn. This would be the most pro-worker reform in history and would largely end the tyranny of the IRS. 2) LEGALIZE all forms of natural medicine, nutritional cures, alternative medicine and preventative medicine. National health care costs would plummet (and Big Pharma would lose trillions of dollars, which is a good thing). End the FDA’s regulatory assault on nutritional supplements that help prevent disease. 3) LEGALIZE gold, silver and Bitcoin as “legal tender” across the country to unleash America’s economic abundance and let people have self-custody of what they’ve earned. 4) De-list cannabis from federal Schedule One status so that CBD supplements and personal care products could be legally sold and possessed across the country, and so that small businesses that sell CBD products could easily work with banks like any other business. 5) Announce a plan to close down U.S. military bases and pull troops out of the Middle East and numerous countries around the world. End America’s illegal occupation of foreign nations, and halt America’s continued sending of weapons to Israel, pushing Israel to negotiate peace terms with its neighbors.",2024-08-12T03:27:01,1580,190,545

twitter/1866047236276355364,【长贴预警】对12.9中央政治局会议政策的看法  一、基本情况  总基调：稳中求进，以进促稳。  政策思路：更加积极的财政+适度宽松的货币政策  地产&股市：主打一个“稳”  产业政策：科技创新引领新质生产力发展，建设现代化产业体系  二、核心要点  1、对政策的整体看法：中性偏乐观，但并不是大大的超出乐观预期。  通稿一出来，很多的解读落脚点“适度宽松的货币”，这的确是2009-2010年以来第一次的货币政策转向，事实上这一点并不太令人意外，前期我在分析中提到过，926政治局之后，政策转向是很明确的，那么也就意味着在目前的经济现状下，维持去年的政策基调基本不可能，适度宽松是必须要做的。  2、适度宽松的货币政策意味着什么？  上一次的政策基调是在2009-2010年，彼时全球金融危机下的衰退复苏，美元流动性泛滥，利率低位，全球发达国家主要在去杠杆；国内当时经济放缓，工业化和出口正处在高峰，于是4万亿砸向了基建和地产。 当前的现状与过去有很大的不同，除了经济增速放缓之外，外需拉动作用减弱，内需不振，地方债务高企、工业化的整体驱动都在减弱，关键是降息和降准空间远远低于2009年。 因此，在上一次适度宽松中，降息降准是主要的刺激手段，还是比较传统的信贷扩张逻辑。那么这一次，降息和降准依然会有，但效果显然不能和上一次相比，尤其是地方债和银行资本的问题，这个空间进一步缩小；那么如何适度宽松就跟上一次不完全不一样了，最大概率是非传统货币政策下的结构化工具会远超过上一次，如同我上次的分析平准、再贷款、PSL等工具是完全值得期待的。  3、值得关注的要点还有哪些？  1）在会议强调部分，政策基调后边紧跟扩大国内需求。 这意味着内需的优先级更高，高于科技和产业。这表明，央行/财政部的政策将更加注重先短后长的总思路。  2）稳住楼市和股市。 理解一下政府眼中的稳指的是不要大规模下滑，但不意味着要大规模上涨。对于地产而言，该有的托底政策不会听，但核心在于把整体的预期稳住，不至于崩盘。对于股市而言，所谓的稳住就是在现有的基础上改善，而不是刺激，适度的放开部分监管，继续推动长钱入市，减税等措施改善企业利润等等。  3）会议最后一部分的工作要求。会议指出，明年要xxxxx。  稳中求进、以进促稳，守正创新、先立后破，系统集成、协同配合。 这几句话基本是精髓，每一组（八个字）对应不同的内容，分别讲了：总基调、实施原则、实施方法。 后边的手段主要是各类政策。我们主要聚焦方法上，基调和原则基本没有太大变化。方法论上，zy这一次强调的是整体行动，避免合成谬误，所谓的系统集成用大白话就是说，后边各个部委的政策必须具有整体性，服务于总体的方向和原则。这是在对去年的某些部门拖后腿现象进行纠偏。于是在这个基础上，你自然而然就会理解后边为什么要继续加强党的统一领导。  4）如何理解超常规逆周期调节  超常规有两个层面的意思，一个是工具超常规，换言之不再是传统的政策工具，结构性/创新工具居多；二是力度超预期，不超预期的调节只是创新工具而已。 二者结合意味着，一是降准很可能幅度更大或者覆盖面更大的定向降准，利率方面很可能更加密集和额度更大的专项贷款；二是信贷投放会更加具有针对性，资金向现代化产业的信贷配额更大，风险容忍度会更低，或许会将政策性担保机构放进来，将融资风险适当下降，扩张信贷；三是针对股市的平准基金；最后一个则是超出预期的资产购买计划，比如对于地方政府的、企业信用债、小企业票据等等。  5）如何理解要大力提振消费、提高投资效益，全方位扩大国内需求。  提振消费，全方位扩大国内需求并不难理解。但是什么叫提高投资效益非常值得展开。 这就跟2009-2010年的政策对应起来，当年的政策主要投向了基建，那么现阶段是不是还要这么干。从这个通稿中，显然是否定的。提高的投资效益意味着对那些低效甚至无效的基建，国家一定会收紧，各地财政纪律的约束会更加严苛，这意味着资金会转向那些具有产出效益的科技产业/制造产业，而不是基建。  6）如何理解要发挥经济体制改革牵引作用，推动标志性改革举措落地见效  我们当前的经济体制改革核心在：市场机制的完善、分配制度的完善、财税改革、国企改革等等。考虑到近期zy频繁的会见海外机构资本，第一个值得关注就是对外开放领域的落地，尤其是金融领域，这也映照了后边的稳外资、稳外贸；剩下几个所谓“标志性改革”就剩下了粤港澳、长三角一体化、财税改革以及科技改革、绿色转型改革等。这几个改革领域预计都会有相应的重大变革。  7）最后的“会议要求”有什么看点  最后一部分内容往往是讲给各级干部听的内容，换言之这里面就是干部明年的定性KPI内容。  第一个“充分调动各方面积极性，调动干部干事创业的内生动力”，这句话看起来简单，但很有威力，因为从根本上干部创事创业的内生动力，说到底还是升职加薪。调动各方，除了干部群体，就剩下企业家和老百姓了。那综合起来就意味着，在激励机制和考核上，可能要更多往企业和民生挂钩，同时会适当增加干部的试错成本，减少行政负担。不然内生动力是不可能的。  剩下几句话，无非是在说，你们老实点，少给我搞形式主义，按照目标落地，糊弄是不行的。 值得注意的是，加强预期管理，这的确需要加强，各地政府发布会估计会明显增多。 提高政策效能，指的是没有收益的政策不要出，推出政策没有效益及时止损并调整。  接下来就看目标和具体的数据，期待一下中央经济工作会议和两会。,2024-12-09T17:08:25,193,16,64

twitter/1855006386712613195,"🚨I need your help: please share this. My life’s in danger. Last month I wrote an article simply covering genuine allegations made by hundreds of people against the @georgian_legion (it transpired that senior figures stole donations and have been diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars away from brave Ukrainian fighters on the front lines, into their own pockets - one of them even lives in America and accepts the donations to his personal PayPal account). @Official_NAFO have denounced the Georgian Legion. @United24media removed them from their website. But today the Georgian Legion sent men to my apartment, who waited for someone to come out the block so they could get inside, headed straight up to my floor, intimidated my partner, and put Georgian Legion stickers on my front door to show they know where I live. Cctv Video below shows them coming in, going straight up to my floor, then placing one last sticker on the main entrance elevator - I have more videos, also showing the men coming up to my apartment door (my floor and apartment was the only place they went to), but will hand them over to police because they reveal my exact address. This follows me already receiving death threats, and previously they’ve paid for bizarre disinformation to be written about me (written by a man whom Ukrainian police are seeking to arrest for spreading propaganda to help Russia), and had a sham lawyer try to intimidate me and place my life in danger by lying that I (a journalist who has been to the front and has written over 800 pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia articles) am ‘paid by the Kremlin’ and ‘working for the Georgian government’, knowing that those lies can have me killed. Now my partner believes she might be killed and that I might be too when I return….All because I did what journalists are supposed to do and wrote an article covering a public story. @NPU_GOV_UA , @ServiceSsu etc aren’t replying, I can’t get hold of the British ambassador here, @MartinHarrisOBE , and the embassy replied via email saying that they can’t protect me. So what can I possibly do to prevent myself and my partner being potentially murdered? And who is supposed to protect British citizens and journalists whilst they’re in Ukraine doing important work like reporting about Russia’s constant war crimes?  I wouldn’t tweet this if I didn’t think the threat was serious - but it is. If anything happens to me, you’ll know who was behind it.",2024-11-09T05:56:01,2990,0,978

Your poor widowed neighbor and kids SNAP food benefits!   Some 70 million Americans are on  Medicaid in some way, shape or form!   But hey-likely not for long!   Because Trump’s 10 year tax cut extension for billionaires and corporations is up for renewal this year.   And it’s Trump’s #1 spending priority for this year’s budget proposal. His main claim to fame and only legislative accomplishment from Trump 1.0,  HAS  to be renewed this year or it goes  BYE BYE!   And we know Trump can’t have that!   For some history, his original Tax Break  Program for the top 1% and corporations cost the American tax payer 3.5 TRILLION in his first term. Yes thats TRILLION!!!    But thats isn’t even good enough anymore!   Nah- Trump promised his buddies -like MUSK and Murdoch- EVEN BETTER CORPORATE TAX CUTS this time around!! Dropping the corporate tax rate down even lower, from 21% to 15%.   For an added cost of 1 TRILLION That’s right- WHATS ANOTHER TRILLION to bring it to 4.5 trillion in spending for tax breaks for the super rich and corporations.   You didn’t actually believe Trump when he feigned concern for growing deficits and our run away national debt problem, now did you??   Because TODAYS budget proposal just PASSED THE HOUSE, WITH AN ALL REPUBLICAN VOTE ZERO DEMOCRAT VOTE.   And guess what is has listed as Trump’s biggest spending item?   Ta da… Trump’s 4.5 TRILLION 10 year tax cuts extension for billionaires and corporations!   Isn’t that special!   And guess where they are MAKING HUGE CUTS to help pay for this 4.5 TRILLION TAX BREAK,  to include that  added 1 TRILLION??    MEDICAID AND SNAP OF COURSE.   About $200 million from CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM CUTS AS WELL.   Those 70 million struggling everyday Americans don’t need nursing home and health care coverage anymore! Or food assistance for their elderly parents living on social security! Or single neighbors hungry kids.   And hey, climate change isn’t really happening -despite the non stop natural disasters we’ve all been experiencing! So who needs CLEAN ENERGY! Cutting the fist ever clean energy initiatives in Biden’s bipartisan Infrastructure bill won’t matter!   Who cares if future generations have a livable planet anyway! Trump will be long gone by then. 🙄  Nah- they’ll be okay   AS LONG AS TRUMP KEEPS HIS PROMISE to his rich buddies and corporate donors, eagerly expecting their HUGE tax breaks for another 10 years!!!   His MAGA base will forgive him… and if they don’t, heck he doesn’t really need them anymore anyway!   Give me a break!!!  4.5 TRILLION in added spending for unnecessary tax cuts for the top 1% and already thriving corporations,   on the backs of everyday hardworking middle to lower class Americans is BULLSHIT!   In what world is this fair…. 🙄 It’s not. It will require the BIGGEST MEDICAID CUTS IN HISTORY!   And you MAGA folks still think this selfish, self serving President is your savior???   Or that Musk is SLASHING our government and its workforce for the good of the country?? To root out corruption and cut costs? Start paying down our national security debt?   Come on!!!   How is TRUMP AND MUSK’s 4.5 TRILLION DOLLAR TAX BREAK for 10 more years CUTTING spending and making a dent in our national debt???   Newsflash: ITS NOT!   Musk’s actions are meant in part to help get Trump’s  4.5 Trillion tax breaks over the finish line!   While leaving the American taxpayer with a LESS efficient, less skilled, and  understaffed federal government, along with drastic cuts to longstanding MEDICAID AND SNAP PROGRAMS some 70 million Americans depend on!

It’s an Islamic Shia terrorist organisation based in Lebanon.  3. Hezbollah is not a sect or form of religion. It’s a terrorist organisation founded in 1982.  3. Hezbollah has long arms.

twitter/1862448524723724408,// 如何看待染色币的未来采用趋势？  比特币生态来来回回诞生了无数种发币方式，实际上目前没有任何一种真正做到了主流采用，即便是数十亿体量的BRC20，在整个Bitcoin之下也显得极其渺小。  不得不说，比特币生态不管从代币炒作还是从应用角度，都是属于极早期的阶段。限于比特币自身的慢节奏和长期以来的数字黄金基调，罗马不是一天建成的，整个比特币生态的发展也势必要经历无数起起落落，最终为比特币用户所普遍接受。  今天我们可以思考：什么样的标准，能够占据未来市场的主流？从而做出正确的投资选择与建设方向。  「染色币足够 Native」  说回染色币，我一直以来认为这种代币形式最大的优点，还是“原生”，或者说“Native”。  市面上我们能看到的，无数代币形式，都是想方设法在比特币创造一些额外的规则，一些原本不属于比特币的定义。而染色币则是直接用比特币作为代币本体——不管别人认不认识，它首先是比特币，其次才是染色币。  前些天社区发起了“流浪智子”计划，具体而言，就是把这个只值1聪的代币 $sophon 充进各大交易所。使得交易所的更多比特币储备被换为ARC20染色比特币。多数交易所依然只是把它识别为BTC，于是其他用户从交易所再次提币时，会随机收到ARC-20的sophon代币。最简单的案例，表明了：ARC20一直是真正的比特币，连交易所都把它当比特币用，这里不存在任何“空气币”。  不需要额外的账本，不需要额外的侧链，不需要额外的规则。BTC就是染色币的本体，ARC-20的基本单位就是比特币的聪。  在最原始的技术逻辑上，染色币就只是把比特币本身“活用”了。要选一种最适合让大众接受的、也最贴合比特币自身特性的发币方式，染色币一定会有一席之地。  「染色币的历史正统性」  在比特币历史上，论起“资产发行”的话题，染色币一直是开山鼻祖。  早在2012年，染色币（Colored Coin）就是比特币圈子对“资产发行”解决方案的第一个完美设想。First is first，在那以后，比特币历史上十余年来再也没有其他深入人心、广为流传的资产发行方案。在2023年以前，只要谈及在比特币上发币，似乎就只有染色币一个标准答案。  但受限于彼时的比特币链技术硬性局限，10年代以来所有的技术尝试都以失败告终。染色币的夙愿也自那时起成为了区块链历史的一个持续性话题。  什么时候染色币才能被完美实现？什么时候这个最初的愿景才能面世？直到2023年，随着比特币主网的更多技术提案通过，更多拓展空间被解锁。比特币生态迎来了第一次爆发式的百花齐放，铭文、符文、邮票、侧链、Layer2等井喷式发展……其间，一个名为Atomicals的协议迅速占据主流视野，先先后后被Unisat、OKX、Binance集成，ARC-20也开始成为比特币生态的主流标准之一。  今天，人人都把ARC-20错误认为一种“特殊的铭文”，殊不知其真正面目“染色币”才是那个历史性的突破。  只说它是创新，倒不如说它是圆了比特币最初的梦。染色币一直都有，人们一直都知道它，只是直到现在，它才被完美实现。  在铭文最火热的时期，除了BRC20以外，ARC-20是Unisat钱包、OKX钱包、币安钱包都争先接入的第一个协议标准。彼时，ARC-20或许并非最多资金、最受市场青睐的那个，但它能得到普遍性的第一位认可，可见一定是最有可持续性、最富生命力、最具长期前景的。用户不一定都知道Atomicals的历史性定位和意义，但我相信比特币生态第一钱包、世界头部二大交易所一定是对它有充分认识的。  「生态与社区」  一个完整的生态，首先技术和应用是完整的。染色币一直只是Atomicals的代币层面，其他如Bitwork（PoW）、Realm、Dmint、AVM等各个板块，也终将焕发各自的光彩。整个Atomicals至今已经足够成熟，向全比特币圈子的扩散发展已经没有任何理由阻挡。  其次，社区是完整的。有人有社区，便更有了叙事。一个协议能顺利发展一年半载，社区始终在建设，开发者不离不弃，众多项目持续运营。这一现象已经是生态的完美基本面。自我开始发布Atomicals周报，到现在差不多正好3个月，光是这十几周的“进度”，一条写一句话，就已经凑满了一万字。这样的生态是富生命力的，这样的“生命力”让协议发展经久不衰，让叙事可持续，也让ARC-20市场大而不倒。  任何说Atomicals没声音、没人玩、没社区、没项目、没开发者的论调，都是空穴来风。这个协议怎么样，这个生态有没有前途，这个社区靠不靠谱，可以自己来看看。  最原生、最正统、大生态、强社区，这样的协议，在未来比特币生态万亿体量之时，是否能占一席之地？不管是协议层面的应用范围，还是染色币形式的采用趋势，我和社区都坚定看好，我们也确实没有什么起不来的理由。  生态的稳扎稳打、步步为营，注定为未来的无数次阶段性爆发埋下伏笔。慢就是快，是金子总会发光。  #Atomicals #arc20 #Atomarc #quark #Electron $QUARK #Coloredcoin,2024-11-29T18:48:25,65,6,26

twitter/1865807353477509301,"I recently had an insightful conversation with a Senior Buyer at a major retail chain. Their team is working against the clock to shift sourcing out of China in response to potential tariff increases, which could significantly impact their cost structure and consumer prices.  Here’s what I learned:  Tariff Impact Strategy:  If tariffs increase by 10%, their factory plans to absorb the cost.  For increases between 10%-30%, the cost will be shared.  Anything above 30% will inevitably pass to consumers.  Resourcing Challenges:  A recent trip to India highlighted limited improvements in processes and technology at local factories, making it difficult to scale production effectively.  Domestic logistics also remain a bottleneck, with consistent delays and poor feedback from transportation teams.  Balancing Costs & Service Quality:  They’re grappling with the trade-off between low-cost solutions and service reliability, especially as missed delivery windows pile up.  Lead times aren’t being extended, which further compounds costs and complexity.  Looking ahead, they anticipate significant hurdles. If tariffs force a full exit from China, sourcing costs will rise, and consumer prices may follow suit—a challenge that will require innovative solutions and collaboration across supply chain networks.  This conversation underscores the complexities of global trade and the ripple effects of economic policies. It's a reminder of the resilience and adaptability required to navigate today’s supply chain landscape.",2024-12-09T01:15:12,11,6,3

twitter/1846342749878211004,"Your comment is not only filled with misinformation but fueled by hatred and historical distortion. Let's correct your false narrative with facts:  The Jewish people are not colonizers. Jews are indigenous to the land of Israel and have maintained an unbroken connection to this land for over 3,000 years. The modern return of Jews to Israel is not 'colonialism'—it is the fulfillment of their historical, spiritual, and legal right to their ancestral homeland. Jews have always lived in the land of Israel, and this return was reinforced by international law, including the Balfour Declaration and the League of Nations Mandate.  The real Palestinian state already exists—it's Jordan. When the Balfour Declaration was implemented, 78% of the land designated for a Jewish state was given to create Transjordan, which later became Jordan. Historically, Jordan was intended as the Arab-Palestinian state, while the remaining 22% of the land was allocated for a Jewish homeland. If you're concerned about Palestinian rights, look to Jordan, which expelled Palestinians in 1970 after a brutal civil war.  Evicting natives? It was Jews who were forcibly evicted from Arab lands, including Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria (the West Bank) during various conquests. In modern times, Israel has repeatedly made sacrifices for peace, including withdrawing from Gaza in 2005. Instead of peace, Israel has faced relentless terrorism, including rocket fire from Gaza, where Hamas rules with an iron fist and uses its people as human shields. Who are the real oppressors here?  Israel is not a “death cult”—it is a vibrant democracy where Jews, Muslims, Christians, and others live and practice their faiths freely. Israel defends itself against terrorist organizations like Hamas, whose charter explicitly calls for the destruction of Israel and the genocide of Jews. This is religious fanaticism and a true death cult, not Israel's defense of its people.  Jewish terrorism? The real terrorism comes from groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad, which glorify the murder of Jews and commit horrific war crimes. Israel does everything it can to avoid civilian casualties, while these terror groups target civilians on purpose.  It's time to stop spreading dangerous lies. Israel is fighting for its survival against terrorists who openly declare their desire to wipe it off the map. The real solution to peace is not destroying Israel—it's holding the true perpetrators of violence accountable, starting with Hamas.",2024-10-16T08:09:49,267,94,27

Bottom line:  Since Iran is already engaged in an ongoing armed conflict with Israel, Israel need not wait to take defensive action only just before Iran fires its proverbial next shot.  Iran has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict with Israel since at least April 13, 2024, when Iran fired over 300 drones and missiles at Israel.   The 180 missiles launched at Israel on October 1, 2024, plus the Iranian leadership's eliminationist policy towards, and continuing threats against, Israel make clear that the conflict Iran initiated with Israel is ongoing.  Given that ongoing armed conflict, Israel did not need to wait until Iran’s nuclear weapons program, or a next round of Iranian attacks, met an “imminence” test (although the imminence test was indeed met).   1/11",2025-06-14T04:16:35,131,1,38

twitter/1812859196049682783,"Let's compare some details. The Gaza Metro miracle and the complicity of @UNRWA.  To have excavated 600 km of an underground tunnel network of on average 2.5 m high, 3 m wide, 20 to 60 m deep, at least 25 million cubic meter of soil and rock had to have been removed. Taking into consideration there were also 10 m high segments, even several halls, the total amount of removed soil and rock must have been more than 35 million cubic meter.  None of the innocent civilians in Gaza noticed this going on for the past 18 years? Nobody noticed that access to the tunnel network was right into their homes, hospitals, schools, mosques and work places?? Where did those mountains of dirt go? Nobody heard the drilling, hammering and digging? Nobody saw the thousands of concrete mortar trucks driving on and off to deliver concrete for the tunnels? Nobody noticed the 600 km long electrical wiring, water pipes, the communications equipment, air conditioners, lights, rail tracks, tons of food and fuel, even complete kitchens, bathrooms, living and sleeping quarters that were led into the tunnels, whilst the population had, as is claimed, nothing and were starving in that Gaza openair concentration camp?  Nobody missed any of their kids who were forced to dig, around 3000 of them, of which more than 400 have lost their lives in ‘work accidents’.  Nobody noticed the heavily armed 40,000 Hamas and 25,000 PIJ ‘warriors’ entering and leaving those tunnels, right into their homes, hospitals, schools, mosques and work places?  The IDF found tunnels and shafts under civilian homes, mosques, hospitals, schools, businesses.   A Hamas fully equipped communication center and command post was uncovered right below @UNRWA HQ. Electricity was supplied from the HQ building and @UNRWA used the same servers and WiFi for their own communications. Two entrances to the two floors below were inside the HQ. Two tunnels from the underground command post led to other parts of Gaza.    The costs of the Gaza Metro is estimated at $3 to $4 billion, money donated by Qatar, Iran, Arab League, Turkey, Norway, EU and USA.  Money that could have been spent differently, like on infrastructure and building a peaceful, economically sustainable society. But no, terrorism and the goal to annihilate Israel were the priorities.  What’s next?  The world is scrambling to refund the Hamas terrorist infrastructure via so-called 160 anti-Israel NGOs.",2024-07-15T22:38:08,1534,94,411
twitter/1822254561286914119,"IslamoFascism. Since the inception of the third world cult of Islam 1400 years ago, Islamists have killed hundreds of millions of people. They are the biggest human rights abusers, racists, liars, thieves, rapists, misogynists, pedophiles, slave traders, murderers and haters of everything that does not fit in with their Quran. Islamic Jihad is a cancer on humanity and the biggest threat to world peace humankind has ever faced. Islamic Jihad destroyed Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and Zoroastrian worlds throughout the Middle East, Asia and Africa, murdering 400-600 million indigenous peoples, invading and occupying more than 17 million $URL[0] foreign lands. Since 1948, over 99.7% of 11.5 million Muslims in the Middle East were killed by Muslims. They are on their way to destroy Europe and the Americas. As Muammar al-Gaddafi said in 2010: “There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe, without guns, without conquests. The 50 million Muslims of Europe will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.” Human rights? Nonexistent. Women’s rights? Nonexistent. Respect and tolerance for non-Muslims (Kaffirs)? Nonexistent. Salman Rushdie wrote a truthful and very informative book called “The Satanic Verses” and the Muslim world issued an immediate fatwa (death sentence). Their ultimate goal? The World Caliphate, a world submitted to and ruled by Islam, the meaning of the word Islam is Submission. Not “Peace, which is Salaam. Islamic Fascism or IslamoFascism is a 20th century totalitarian movement, a death cult, like fascism and communism. It is designed to brainwash ignorant people, especially naive youngsters, with a utopian future where the world will be ‘cleansed’ of democracies, capitalism, all non-Muslim religions, atheists, black people (Arabs were and still are the biggest slave traders, calling them Abeed), homosexuals, liberated women, and especially the Jews, the longest surviving minority, a mere 0.2% of world population. Islamists are psychopathically obsessed having lost their control of Israel. The proof of the pudding is in the eating for the past 76 years. Islam can be practiced without resorting to the ideologies of Fundamentalist Islam. That regards in fact any religious or political movement. It all depends what percentage of these followers are extreme, and Islam doesn’t score that well. In a survey, between 77% and 98% of Muslims in the MENA countries (90% of Palestinians) want to see Israel destroyed. The fact that 21% of Israelis are non-Jews was for the respondents not an issue. IslamoFascism is a death cult. The Islamic Terror Republic of Iran and its 19 proxies are the main perpetrators. Only the complete destruction of this extremist, bellicose ideology can make this a better world. Nothing else matters.",2024-08-10T20:51:57,146,23,81

Gender: 'So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.' - Gen 1:27  Marriage: ...'a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.' - Gen 2:24  Rainbow: 'Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.” - Gen 9:16  Homosexuality: 'Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men.' - 1 Cor. 6:9  Sexual Immortality: 'Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral persons, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.' Revelation 22:15  Pride: 'To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.' Proverbs 8:13  There is no God: 'In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, 'There is no God.'' Psalm 10:4  Mocking God: 'Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.' - Gal 6:7  These are very offensive scriptures in our current culture.

All of his transgressions that he committed will not be remembered against him. Through his righteousness that he has done he shall live. Have I delight by any means in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord Yahweh, and not at his turning from his way, so that he lives?' Ezekiel 18:21-23  To Christians, stand strong on the truth of God's word. 'For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.' Hebrews 4:12.  I write this with a sincere heart, not to condemn, not to hate, but to save. I found living water, true life in Christ. 'Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all.' 1 Tim 1:15.  To my LGBTQ friends, consider me a true friend. 'A truly good friend will openly correct you.

Belief in the end of this world and the lasting hereafter, alongside the understanding that our deeds in this life determine our eternal destinies after death, creates balance and moderation. This balance prevents extremes of attachment to this worldly life as if there is nothing after it, while also avoiding excessive asceticism and neglect of its value and duration.

The more we oppose Trump and the cult members are perplexed, the more some of them are starting to ask questions...     Some even start to realize, we do not support DT because he is pro abortions, pro trans, anti 2A, pro vaccines, pro masks, pro lockdowns, failed abysmal with the border, increased the deficit, gave the medal of honor to Fauci (and even today on his campaign trail he still claims it was the right thing re covid).    DT was so focused on looking 'tough' on social media that he appointed all the wrong people in his administration. It was 4 years of drama and minimal accomplishments just because of his ego and extreme incompetence. He and his 'followers' have burned bridges with most so now they 'reap what they sow'      Once they start questioning the maga gospel, it leads to awakening for the ones doing a bit of research apart from the talking points.    So the question is what's next? Do you care about the country? Do you want to win against the woke liberals and democrats? Are you patriots or just fakes? Are you conservatives or pretenders?    If the answers are yes to being a Conservative, Patriot then join us in the movement to get Ron DeSantis back in the race and win the elections. We all know that without him as President, nothing will change (or at least not in good).        There is a reason RD's campaign settled for the Great American Comeback motto/slogan. It is as much about him as it is about the country and we cannot have one without the other!

Iran will appear to agree to go back to negotiations and Trump will declare victory like he did with the Tariffs.  Behind the scenes though they will eat humble pie and accept some uncomfortable terms - including Uranium enrichment to any levels they want, lifting of sanctions and ending the genocide in Gaza.  There is no way to knock out Iran. It would have to be a long protracted war of attrition.  US can’t pull that off while their eyes are set on China.  And China and Russia will never let Iran fall.

He wasn't a career politician; he was a disruptor. He exposed the deep-seated corruption and the swamp creatures in D.C. That's not something to just brush aside.  As for DeSantis, he's a strong candidate, no doubt. But to say Trump is 'afraid' of him? Come on, that's reading tea leaves. Trump's still a force to be reckoned with, and his base is rock solid. DeSantis has shown he can shake things up in Florida, and he's got a promising future. But Jenna, what makes you think DeSantis won't face the same establishment roadblocks and media smear campaigns that Trump did? If they can do it to a sitting president, they can do it to a governor.

twitter/1855350535517356205,"Ivy League Land   In the unhallowed halls of Harvard, where wisdom ought to dwell, The learned youth now gather, their grievances to spell. For the world, it now seems, doesn't give a hoot, About the sniveling musings from their ivory pursuit.  Oh, the classes canceled, for a show of such despair, That their dogmas, once prized, now float upon thin air. The nation, in its wisdom, or perhaps in sheer disdain, Has left these scholars' haughty thoughts to wither, as autumn's rotting grain.  Dostoyevsky, that Russian sage, with keen prophetic sight, Noted once the greatest sin: self-betrayal in the night. For nothing, these young minds, in Ivy Towers high, Have sold their souls to a twisted hive, and watched their reputations die.  Our future doctors, lawyers, scribes, in need of crayon time? How comforting in times of need, to hear them whinge and whine. Beware the diplomas, hanging with such pride, Sat before them is a child who needs consoling, when your kin has died.  And now, they ponder, amidst their mental strife, Why the common man has lost all faith in academic life. Too much coddling, too little grit, decisions made in stead, By those who claim the right to guide, yet lead us all to dread.  Bleeding hearts of academia, wake up to reality's glare, It's not just your minds in need of care, but your souls, laid bare. The backbone of America, the middle class so true, Doesn't want your bought degrees, but the excellence you eschew.  So when the polls closed, and the ballots were all cast, The 'uneducated' masses rose, and saved us from that blast. A presidency of Marxist decrees, from which they did retreat, Perhaps because they keep the values, the elite don't want to meet.  So, send not your children to these halls of learned jest, Let them not be harmed, in wallet, mind, or spirit, lest They come back not with wisdom, but with a soul of clay, From universities where 'Self-Care Suites' hold sway.  With Legos, cookies, and coloring books for play, In times of stress, this is how they choose to stay. Yes, this is real, beyond the reach of satire's touch, In Ivy League Land, where common sense is clutched too much.",2024-11-10T04:43:33,39,8,40

Biden and Harris, in a grand redesign, Unleashed the floodgates to humanity's tide.  Unscreened, unfiltered, the masses came, A reality blurred, not quite the same. Into communities, like a dream or a lie, They poured, overwhelming, and innocents died.  Infrastructure creaks, on a once stable frame, Now bends, like old bones, under the strain. Historic voices, once clear, now silenced, As trusting towns fall prey to violence.   Malice, a specter, in this new reality,  Moves through the streets, with cold brutality. The dream of openness, now a double-edged sword, As the cost of freedom strikes a discordant chord.  In the modern world, where truth and illusion blend, This policy, a narrative, begins to rend. A society, in flux, where lines blur, In this unfolding tale, who is the stirrer?",2024-10-13T03:13:40,35,4,30

I spent 2 hours chatting with others who attended the show. I live in a very liberal area of Maine, most of the people I spoke to were also liberal. I did however, get to chat with one older lady who had just purchased a piece of art. At first our conversation was very light. She mentioned that she and her husband live in Texas during the winter and spend their summers here in Maine. I asked her how she liked the Democratic candidate for Senate, Colin Allred. This was her answer, “oh no! We love Ted and Abbott.” I was appalled. I asked her why and she didn’t have anything to substantiate her choice other than a shrug of her shoulders. I then asked her if she was for Trump and of course her answer was yes. I asked  if she was concerned about him being a convicted felon. Her answer was “no, that is just political.” As I was about to ask her what she thought of Project 2025, her husband grabbed her by the arm and pulled her away. Conversation over. Just goes to show, you can’t get through to a Trumper. They are blinded by his hateful rhetoric and will follow this disgusting man who is in the presidential race again for his fragile ego and retribution.

twitter/1823784456936972757,"You and I can’t understand how a professing Christian could vote for a rabid abortion warrior like Kamala Harris or a mostly-lefty like RFK Jr or give someone half a vote by writing in, but, based on the many Christian women I talk to every day, I can tell you their calculation. I know you disagree with them. I disagree with them too. But, so you know, this, in general, is their thinking:  Abortion is the main issue, and they see every candidate as functionally pro-choice. To true pro-lifers, there is no moral difference between abortion at 16 weeks (DJT),  abortion at 40 weeks (KH), and an abortion somewhere in between (RFK), since all human life is equal in worth. Most abortions happen before 12 weeks anyway. Trump condemned Florida’s heartbeat law. If it’s truly a “state’s rights” issue, then the president probably won’t make a big difference anyway. The “follow your heart” language is also, on a theological level, a huge turnoff to Christians (see Jeremiah 17:9).   When “Christians for Kamala” puts out an ad demonstrating that Trump doesn’t know the gospel, the kind of Christian woman they’re actually impacting is not the one who will vote Kamala. They know Kamala doesn’t know the Bible from the kamasutra and that her policies are evil. But now they may see that Trump also seems unfamiliar with the Bible and consider that his abortion policy may not be that much better. So they are likely to be demoralized altogether or incentivized to vote for someone else.   So, a vital percentage of pro-lifers either will not vote for president or they’ll write someone in. Another - smaller - percentage tell me they think RFK’s policies will help lower abortions through other means and that medical freedom is key to their support.   But as I engage with these voters, I can tell that most - if not all- of their votes are still up for grabs. They can be persuaded. And these votes, once secured, are more reliable and therefore more valuable than the secular, independent libs Trump seems to be vying for. Persuade those people too, sure, but that crowd is fickle. Many of them can’t even be trusted to vote, much less enthusiastically, publicly support Republicans.   Trump must fight to secure for every single pro-life Christian vote. He cannot win without them. And if you think, “they’ll vote Trump, because they have nowhere else to go,” you’ve made a fatal miscalculation. They see voting for a pro-choice candidate as rewarding compromise, and, yes, they’d rather Republicans lose than play a role in that.   You can call that insane, but, instead of that, try to persuade them. The Harris/Walz record on abortion and straight-up infanticide is so bleak. Their positions on immigration and economics are destructive. They are agents of chaos. All of this has a huge, tangible effect on our children and the neighbors whom we are called to love.   There is percentage of professing Christian women who will vote Kamala, but they’re not in my audience and they probably can’t be persuaded to switch their vote, as their support of her speaks to, in my view, some very fundamental errors re human nature, good vs evil, the role of the government, etc. that we probably don’t have time to correct in the next 85+ days.   Don’t criticize these persuadable voters, and ignore them at your peril. Instead, convince them. Remind them the chaos they’re voting against and the security, stability, and normalcy they’re voting for when they vote for Trump.   Just my two cents!",2024-08-15T02:11:13,3000,504,506

twitter/1893426956185526402,"I will let you decide, do tell me if you believe them to be real or fake:  In 1945 German archaeologist, Waldemar Julsrud discovered clay figurines buried at the foot of El Toro Mountain on the outskirts of Acámbaro, Guanajuato Mexico. Eventually over 37,000 figurines and artefacts were found. They were similar to artefacts identified with the Pre-classical Chupicuaro Culture (800BC - 200AD) found in this area. Radiocarbon and thermoluminescent testing has supported these estimates. The authenticity of the find has been challenged because the collection included dinosaurs. Many archaeologists believe dinosaurs have been extinct for the past 65 million years and man's knowledge of them has been limited to the past 200 years. If man saw and modelled them 2500 years ago, this view would be falsified. Dr. Patton, together with Dr. Dennis Swift have made five trips to Acámbaro in order to conduct their own personal investigation. The collection had been locked away for years but access was attained. You will hear the intriguing story, evaluate the testimony of many respectable, knowledgeable eye witnesses and you will be able to view the evidence for yourself.  Dr. Patton has a broad educational background; four years at Florida College, Temple Terrace, FL (Bible); two years at Austin Peay State University, Clarksville, TN (Geology); two years at Indiana Univ.Purdue Univ., Indianapolis, IN (Geology); two years, Pacific School of Graduate Studies. He has worked as Geologist in US, Canada, Australia, England, Mexico, Peru, bolvia, Cambodia, Israel, and Jordan. Dr. Patton has participated in dinosaur excavations in Colorado, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and Canada. He is credited with excavating the longest consecutive dinosaur trail in North America, totaling 157 tracks, extending over 500 feet. He is a member of the Geological Society of America and was a speaker at their 1997 annual convention. Dr. Patton lectures at universities across the United States. He has conducted up to twelve Creation/Evolution Seminars a year for twenty five years. He has participated in numerous public debates on creation/evolution including radio and TV debates. He has testified three times before Texas State Textbook Committee, Austin, TX. Presently, Dr. Patton is consulting geologist & partner in Masada Corporation, Dallas, TX. He is a staff geologist of the Creation Evidence Museum, Glen Rose, TX, staff geologist for the Qumran Plateau excavation in Israel, an area supervisor at the City of David excavation in Jerusalem and chairman of the Metroplex Institute of Oregon Science.",2025-02-23T06:25:39,10,2,4

He had  f o u r  years, yet:  • Operated self-enrichment pay-for-play/pay-for-access schemes that benefitted corporations, foreign adversaries, & himself at the expense of the majority of American Citizens.  • Passed a Tax Bill that raised taxes for everyone but the top 1%:  • People who earn under $75,000 have had their taxes raised in 2021.  • People who earn under $75,000 have had their taxes raised in 2023.  • People who earn under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2025.  • People who earn under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2027.  • He lied about his ‘healthcare plan.’  • He lied about his ‘infrastructure plan.’  • He lied about his ‘middle-class tax reduction plan.’  • During Trump’s first 3 years, rate of disposable Income dropped from 2.6% to 2.3%.  • Household income increased only $550 in the first year after implementation of the 2017 Tax Cuts - far behind the previous three years and not close to the $4,000 to $9,000 or more per household that his administration had claimed.  • Business Investments, which are essential to a stronger Economy, lagged substantially behind the average of the quarters that preceded the 2017 Tax Cuts.  • Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers (who account for 80% of the workforce) grew by 1.2% on average, during Trump’s first three years, compared to 1.3% during President Obama's last three years.  • Real median annual earnings, moreover, grew a percentage point slower under Donald Trump than under his predecessor.  • Trump’s erratic actions on trade and tariffs have substantially hurt workers & communities.  • Trump instigated ‘Tariff Wars’ with China, which bankrupted our farmers, steel producers, small businesses including Harley-Davidson, & passed the resultant exorbitant spike in costs onto the consumer.  • China was never required to pay a penny in Tariffs. All Tariffs were paid by American importers of Chinese products. This increase in costs were subsequently passed down to U.S. consumers.  • Trump’s destructive, retaliative trade policies destroyed the livelihood of farmers, to the extent that he had no choice but to bail them out, in an attempt to avoid tarnishing the illusion of ‘his economy.’  • Trump’s Tariff Wars triggered Hyper-Inflation in The U.S.  • Trump’s trade policies cost the United States 245,000+ jobs. His reckless trade policies were based on obsolete ideas about how trade works - they completely ignored the fundamental sources of U.S. trade imbalances.  • Trump’s Tariff Wars became a persistent source of the most insidious form of taxation on the poor, middle, & working class.  • The Trump administration has allowed America’s Infrastructure to deteriorate.  • The Trump administration has brought in record numbers of Corporate & Industry lobbyists at the expense of the American people:  • After famously promising to “drain the swamp,” President Trump brought in “staggering” numbers of corporate lobbyists and tapped them to oversee the very industries from which they came. Turning over the reins of government to corporate lobbyists has resulted in serious consequences for the American people.  Among many other special interest giveaways, the Trump administration has:  • Undermined Wage Theft Enforcement, making it more difficult to prosecute against employers who steal from employees - a problem that costs workers more than $50Billion annually.  • Encouraged companies to force workers into mandatory arbitration agreements, which has left 60Million workers unable to bring class-action lawsuits to workplace disputes.  • Allowed companies to classify certain workers as “independent contractors” to exclude them from Federal Labor Law Protections.  • Dismantled Environmental Protections that keep air, water, and the environment clean while undermining communities’ input on projects in their backyards.  • Propped up for-profit colleges, where students are four times more likely than students who attend not-for-profit colleges to default on loans and where 88 percent of borrows have debt upon graduation - a rate higher than both public and nonprofit schools.  Donald Trump, in four years: • Did away with Consumer and Renters Protections.  • Cut SNAP benefits for a broad swath of SNAP households.  • Cut Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) programs by $6.8Billion (14.2%) below the 2017 level, not counting losses due to Inflation.  • Raised rents on low-income families with HUD Rental Assistance.  • Cut funding for public housing repairs by $3.0Billion or 47 percent, compared to 2017, virtually assuring a loss of affordable housing stock in communities facing massive shortages of such housing.  • Eliminated the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)  • Donald Trump inherited the longest Economic expansion in U.S. history from President Obama and left office as the first president since World War II to oversee Net Job Loss during his term.  • Even before the coronavirus, job growth under Donald Trump had slowed: just 183,000 new jobs on average were added during his first three years in office. He left office with 3Million fewer Americans employed than when he was sworn in.  • Despite inheriting an Economy with a 4.7% unemployment rate, Donald Trump left office with an unemployment rate of 6.3%.  • The Trump administration has targeted Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid after having promised never to touch them.  Steps taken from 2021 to mitigate the extraordinary damage done by Donald Trump: In 3 years, Biden: • Reduced poverty in the USA by over 40%, to the lowest rate in American History. • Created 15.6Million+ Jobs, in addition to: • Highest workforce participation in 15 years. • Unemployment Rate under 3.8%, at a 50 yr low. • Wages & Labor Participation up, Inflation down again. • Record 3+ years of consistent Job Growth at levels which exceed Pre-Pandemic levels. • Record $1.8Trillion Deficit Reduction, reversing Trump $7.8Trillion Disaster. • ‘Smart Border Technology’ - $1.5Billion for Border Security - paid for by Mexico. • Uninsured Rate fell to 8% - Lowest in History. • Passed The Infrastructure Bill: Rebuilds highways, airports, rail, grid, creates new jobs nationwide. • Passed The Chips and Science Act for U.S. Leadership in Technology & Manufacturing: Brings back manufacturing to the U.S. • Passed The American Rescue Plan: led to fastest jobs recovery in history, reduced poverty to a historic low. • Passed The Inflation Reduction Act: Caps medical costs, R/X, Insulin costs. • Lowered Health Care Costs & Improved Health Resources for Black Communities. • Lowered Prescription Drug Costs. • Capped medical costs, R/X, Insulin costs. • Reduced the Burden of Medical Debt on Black Americans. • Advanced Public Safety for & within Black Communities. • Re-issued the Call for Congress to Pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. • Lower Food & Fuel Costs Act: • Lowers Food Costs by reducing fertilizer costs. • Lowers Meat & Poultry Costs via expanding competition amongst meatpacking companies. • Lowers Gasoline costs with cheaper, cleaner Unleaded 88.  • To combat the deliberately-increased oil/gasoline/diesel prices, Joe Biden has increased Domestic Oil Production to an All-Time-Record-High of 13.3+Million barrels/day. This increased U.S. Oil Production has reduced oil prices to below pre-pandemic levels while ensuring U.S. Energy Independence.

House Speaker Mike Johnson Will Push Aid for Israel, Ukraine this Week  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said he will be pushing aid for Israel and Ukraine this week as part of a national security package he has been working on for several months.  “The Republican speaker has sat for two months on a $95 billion supplemental package that would send support to the U.S. allies, as well as provide humanitarian aid for civilians in Ukraine and Gaza and funding to replenish U.S. weapons provided to Taiwan,” noted the Associated Press (AP).  Speaking with Fox News on Sunday, Johnson said that he and other Republicans “understand the necessity of standing with Israel,” adding that he would be advancing the aid this week.  “The details of that package are being put together right now,” he said. “We’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.”  Likewise, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told reporters in the wake of the attack that President Joe Biden spoke with top Republicans and Democrats in Congress, adding that there was a consensus “among all the leaders that we had to help Israel and help Ukraine, and now hopefully we can work that out and get this done next week.”  “It’s vital for the future of Ukraine, for Israel and the West,” Schumer said. $URL[0] via @BreitbartNews",2024-04-15T17:56:09,29,43,11

(See the chat below.)  @AZInformer uncovered that PCH receives a large sum of federal money, as most hospitals do. PCH is still making appointments for their Gender Support clinic. If they are prescribing 'gender affirming' drugs, this would violate the @POTUS Executive Order. $URL[0]  PCH, are you continuing to provide children with 'gender affirming care' drugs? Or is Dr. Chulani going to continue writing prescriptions for kids who think they're trans under a different medical code?",2025-02-11T03:50:33,12,0,7

twitter/1904174096042361326,"No, Ireland did not reject Rosie O’Donnell’s request for permanent residency or give her 30 days to leave. This claim appears to stem from a satirical article published by The Dunning-Kruger Times on March 19, 2025, which falsely stated that the Irish government denied her residency. In reality, Rosie O’Donnell voluntarily moved to Ireland in mid-January 2025 with her 12-year-old child, Clay, and has publicly confirmed she is in the process of applying for Irish citizenship through her grandparents’ heritage. She has expressed positive sentiments about her relocation, describing the Irish people as welcoming, and there are no credible reports of any rejection or deportation order as of March 24, 2025. The rumor has been debunked by fact-checkers and contradicted by her own statements on platforms like TikTok and interviews, such as her appearance on RTE’s The Late Late Show on March 21, 2025. Posts on X echoing the claim reflect misinformation rather than fact.",2025-03-24T22:10:56,1863,174,90
