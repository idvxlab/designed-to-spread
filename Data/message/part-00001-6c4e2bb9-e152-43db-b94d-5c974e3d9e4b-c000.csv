twitter/1844101255578386701,I know in the last few days there have been an enormous amount of conversations going on about Weather Modification & GeoEngineering. I also understand that it’s a very touchy subject and incredibly difficult to come to terms with that this is being done to us without our consent.   Here’s a link to my TikTok account where I have over 400 + videos of GeoEngineering that I have documented primarily from my home with the exception of maybe one or two that were elsewhere.   My ask is that you scroll all the way down to the very bottom and work your way back up through the videos so that you see the progression of each day and start to recognize all the patterns like I do. There are many days where I documented from before sunrise or shortly after and until sunset or late afternoon.   We have to start learning to trust our own eyes again and not be reliant on some “authority” figure to tell us that what we’re seeing with our own eyes isn’t happening.   Please know that all of this is coming from a place of love! It’s hard to awaken to the fact that we’ve been lied to for so long and so many things that we have believed aren’t true. Please also know that there’s so many of us that have already gone through this tough process of coming to grips with fact that what we once believed to be our reality for so long truly isn’t. We are here to help everyone that is just starting to understand these things and support you.   God bless all of you! Stay safe! 🙏💜🫂  $URL[0],2024-10-10T03:42:55,1454,295,718

twitter/1953609150417842617,GM 来讲一下主播视角的 @Sidekick_Labs   作为sidekick早期的主播，我算是看着sidekick做起来的，我很清楚他们一路走来多么脚踏实地和不容易  首先感谢sidekick团队看中了我的账号，其实我的流量起飞也得益于这个平台。  很早之前，我被喷得特别狠，公开的地址盈利较多，很多人都说我是专门开盘割人的。甚至还有人给我发来死亡威胁，我只是一个22岁手无缚鸡之力的小孩，哪里见过这些东西  但是自从在sidekick直播，我很多时候一播就是十几个小时，完全枯坐 ，向大众展示了我是如何扫链的，慢慢地这些声音变成了：96虽然畜，但是真有点东西  虽然现在还是有人来喷我，毕竟PVP是残酷的，很多时候我并没有在故意浇给，正常操作盈利落袋而已，但是我已经开始不在意这些东西了，我几乎全程录屏直播，已经证明了自己  以上说的是平台的存在对于主播的益处  那么下面我再讲讲，我跟sidekick合作的过程中，我是怎么感受到这是一个真在做事的平台  1.兄弟，这完全是一个全新叙事 LiveFi的第一枪是sidekick打响的。  web2抖音刚出来的时候，也是一直被喷，但是现在我很少见人不玩抖音。革命是漫长的，结果是灿烂的  再说了，这只是一个发展4个月的平台，能做到这种程度，谁敢说不牛逼？  而且这个平台办的比赛，是真的好。中韩LOL比赛，各种高规格的配置，未来还有PUBG比赛，我也在练习，想和sidekick一起在web3玩点新东西  你说说之前我们哪有这种细糠吃？  2.团队非常负责 每一次对接基本上都是秒回复，天选客服 @Roysidekick    几乎什么时候都能找到，当然还有很多负责的同事，比如：@AstiIsmeme @Crypto_Yulia 等等   而且在对接工作群里，他们的回复一点都不死板，每天都能像朋友一样一起玩梗聊天吹水，我更喜欢和这样的团队共事  3.老板非常有想法 在上海的时候有幸跟老板 @HeyfishYC 陈机智一起吃了顿早餐，老板的营销思路，我觉得是非常厉害的，聊了有些东西现在不能公开说，反正sidekick未来会越来越牛逼就是了，喷子们且看着  顶尖！,2025-08-08T08:08:12,78,53,2

twitter/1843314113277272380,这我就有发言权了，只张嘴说这事肯定没那么简单。       首先你说你就五万，那交完钱在第一次欠费的时候就会停药，医院不是慈善机构，你不交钱床都没得给你躺，你还想欠三十万，做梦呢？      第二，既然欠费三十万了，要么病人找医院做了什么利益交换（但是这种三甲医院我觉得不会有求于普通人），要么就是试药，试药的话除非是医疗公司事先和医院谈好了，这药品按正常价格算病人账单去，后面公司再付，然后因为各种原因可能这笔钱医院收不到了，（也可能病人不配合接着搞了）只能找病人家属了，其他方面我是想不到正常治疗他怎么欠费三十万出来的，有医生在推上如果了解的话可以出来说说，毕竟欠几百几千就直接停药了，停床位了，怎么可能让你欠出三十万，然后肿瘤医院床位是全满的，超载运行的，比如一个科室50个床位，但是实际上可能挂名了150个人，因为一般化疗加放疗或者手术来治疗肿瘤，肿瘤治疗时安排A来1床躺着，一周治完（比如化疗）结束后，B就来躺着用1床，之后就C这样循环往复，反正我看了半年时间床就没空过，然后一般长期治疗患者又没法一直睡医院床，所以就得就近租房，既然租了房子，可能也就不会每天都睡在房间，有时候医生还会打电话给你借用一下你的床位……但是一般每次治疗都要办理一次入院，一周后结束了又要办理出院，过了观察期再继续入院，出院。查房的话如果不在护士站会打电话跟你确认今天回不回来，然后她们会做记录，然后手术后反正得住院住到出院，这个医生也不敢让你自己跑路，但是放疗人群每天就十分钟二十分钟就结束了，所以你虽然挂着个床位但是床位不会给你用，你放疗完就回租房或者自己回家，普通人去医院准备钱就行了，如果有医保加商业险勉强还行，上了重疾保险的话医保后的钱基本都能赔付到位。如果只靠医保，那就交钱吧，如果要用靶向药你还得填申请单子然后送当地医保局去批复，批复同意了再带着盖章的纸送回医院，你才能用上报销60%的靶向药，也是你自己先付款，后面带着发票回当地医保局报销60%。,2024-10-07T23:35:06,22,9,0

That he lets us go and leaves.  I ask that he accept Elon Musk’s proposal and go into exile with amnesty.  In six years in power, he has plundered our country for billions of dollars. He has begun raiding other people’s businesses, stealing from road construction, from COVID funds, from weapons. Even from graves—profiting from kickbacks on the construction of a military cemetery.  In six years, he has taken control of all media in the country. In six years, he has arrested or intimidated all opposition figures.  In Ukraine, we are hostages of a terrorist. Members of parliament are even afraid to announce his impeachment because they would immediately be labeled traitors and arrested. As you can see, only one MP out of 450 dared to do it—Oleksandr Dubinsky, and he has already been in prison for a year, being tortured.  Three years after he refused to stop the war for the sake of holding onto power, the situation on the front has only worsened. We have lost even more cities, even more people, even more infrastructure. But like a true dictator, he assures the people that they must continue and that victory is ahead! Doesn’t this remind you of famous historical examples from the 20th century?  He has closed the borders for his own citizens and turned the country into a prison. He has built a wall and barbed wire on the border with the European Union so that people cannot escape! He captures Ukrainians right on the streets if they do not want to go to the front, throws them into basements, tortures, and kills them.  He stole money from Americans and Europeans.  Unlimited financial aid gave him and his team the opportunity to recklessly manage Ukraine’s budget, disregarding the money of Ukrainian taxpayers. He even created a new ministry with a huge number of officials instead of cutting expenses, as Musk does at DOGE. And this is a country at war, begging for money from everyone, yet not making a single budget cut! Zelensky’s ministers receive salaries of millions of dollars per year.   During the war, in 2023, Zelensky even allocated $1 million from the budget to produce an entertainment talk show for his godmother, friend, and business partner at his company “Kvartal 95,” Olena Kravets. Does his friend need a million dollars? Let her take it from the Ukrainian budget!  At the same time, he deceived and exploited well-known American celebrities, including Sean Penn and Ben Stiller, making them raise money and donate their own funds to his United24 foundation. Americans should conduct an audit of this fund!  He wants to continue the war, even though any reasonable person understands that this is suicide. He openly states that he will not allow Americans and Ukrainians to hold elections in which someone else wins instead of him.  The United States stands for peace, based on freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and freedom from fear. Zelensky’s Ukraine is the direct opposite of the principles the United States upholds. Zelensky’s Ukraine is a world built on fear, the suppression of free speech, the suppression of religion, and the cancellation of elections—the very foundation of the free world.  Zelensky will not leave. Therefore, the United States must help us and impose personal sanctions not only against Zelensky and his team but also against the propagandists who work for the regime and are currently spreading anti-American propaganda in Ukraine and worldwide, poisoning people’s minds with fake news. This is direct interference by Ukrainian propagandists, paid by Zelensky, who are attacking American democracy. I am ready to provide a full list of these individuals.  @EricTrump @elonmusk @TuckerCarlson @DavidSacks  @JackPosobiec  @DonaldJTrumpJr @WhiteHouse @Surabees @CortesSteve  @CilComLFC @RobSchneider @ggreenwald @JamesBradleyCA @stillgray @MAGAResource",2025-03-05T12:29:05,0,0,8285

twitter/1708672620848099458,"#NAFO  I want to thank everyone who stands with Ukraine and for freedom. And I'd like to say a few things.  Firstly, I do understand how difficult standing up to russia and its propaganda online can be for many of you, and the sacrifices you make, on many, many levels.   There's the sacrifice of time and money, of course, but there's a greater, more personal sacrifice as well - the sacrifice of meeting the utter lunacy of russian trolls and propagandists every day, and the courage and heroism of going against them - of going against what is sometimes sheer illogic and insanity... and of making sure that sanity prevails.  And that's what we do, my fellow warriors - we fight to ensure that sanity prevails - and that the children of the future will live in a safer world. ---  And I know how difficult things may sometimes be for each of you, and I just wanted to say...       Keep the faith, my brothers and sisters - things aren't always as dark as they seem. We're walking through a long, dark tunnel, and it seems that all the very worst instincts of humanity are doing their best to conquer us - but they will not. For the simple reason that we're better men and women than they are, and we have better reasons for fighting on.  ---  For those who meet russian propaganda every day...      Remember that it's very important that you take a break from things sometimes, to relax, to unwind, and perhaps, for a few hours, to just forget. No one can fight continuously - remember that even the soldiers fighting on the front line are rotated out regularly (well, those on our side, at least) else they wouldn't be able to keep fighting. ---  Most of all, as I said, things aren't actually as dark as they appear sometimes.   Imagine how dark things appeared to the brave lads on the first morning of the invasion, when they went out into the cold, black dawn to stand against russia.   They didn't know that they would break the back of russia's armored legions and make russia the laughing stock of the whole world. They didn't know that they would win - or even that they could win.   But they went out into that cold morning to stand against russia anyway. And they broke the back of russia's armies.  And that's courage - to make a stand, when you don't know where that stand will lead, but to make the stand anyway, because it's the right thing to do - because, being human, one must do it, or sacrifice one's humanity.  And that's what this war is about, strangely enough.   It's not really about language, or territory, or religion, or politics - those are just russia's excuses.  No, this is a war of values.   Freedom against slavery. Democracy against dictatorships. The right to speak against the necessity to remain forever silent.   The ability of free people to feel for those in need, for those oppressed, for the little children in danger... stacked against the ability of the people of a dictatorship or an empire to close their eyes to and turn their backs on suffering.  It's a war of ideas and values.  And we WILL win it, my brothers and sisters.   Because in a war of ideas, the real strength lies in the ideas themselves.  Keep the faith.   And thank you, every one of you, for being good and wonderful human beings whom I admire, and who inspire me in turn - every single day.  Slava Ukraini! Your humanity give us courage!",2023-10-02T10:37:53,3898,300,981

twitter/1770478218342207874,圈外对我们产生的恶意，混合了极大的偏见和嫉妒  韩国的生育率全世界最低，炒币率却是全世界最高 因为韩国是财阀垄断的社会，底层人民上升极端困难 时常有看到韩国女明星怎么样怎么样的新闻，灯红酒绿 有的人高高在上泯灭人性地去奴役他人 被压迫者男靠跪女靠娼 连总统都得看财阀脸色  这样的国家人民没希望了，那就干脆把命运的机会寄托在币圈上，于是韩国3个人就有1个人是炒币的 可以说是全民投机  回到国内 抖音贴吧知乎等等Web2软件上有众多的看空人群 他们大多数人并不了解什么是数字货币，一开口就是庞氏骗局资金盘，郁金香，击鼓传花这几样 每次暴跌爆仓他们都会大声叫好，归根结底的原因是什么？  为什么大部分人对币圈有这么大的恶意？ 这些年能暴富的就是互联网和房地产 你明知道这个东西不值这么多钱，却眼睁睁的看它涨啊涨，那种无力感可以自己体会一下 又会后悔当初自己怎么没有上车呢  当下的中国的投机暴富心态已经变成了病态 每个人心中都渴望暴富 数字货币让一部分人暴富，却让没有参与进来的认眼红  过去二十多年，互联网和房地产让很多人发了财，拆迁户靠投胎发财 唯独老老实实工作的没有发财，反而被割韭菜割的最狠  经过这二十几年来的现实教育，多数人开始认清一个现实： 靠死工资是很难实现阶级跃升的 已有的收入和保障很难对抗未来人生之路的重疾等潜在风险  币圈的投机性是很强，但其实并不是最根本的原因 根本原因是：有话语权的人对于币圈视为洪水猛兽，大家能看到出来真臂高呼的人，基本都是old money的既得利益者 他们并不希望有人突然杀出 用自己看不懂的方式迅速暴发成了new money新贵 在一定程度上动摇了他们原本的上升框架，产生了危机感。  或许会有人反驳，很多人也血本无归吗？ 其实股市这样的故事又何其多呢，为什么不关了股市？ 因为股市是old money垄断的游戏，旧的势力在这里赚的盆满钵满 而币圈儿则是一条新赛道，原本的大部分旧势力没来得及适应赚不到这个钱 他们不会在乎这个投不投机啊，更不会在乎有没有人因此受损失  什么人最支持币圈呢？ 旧势力眼中的屌丝，当然也包括我 还有就是一些看不到希望的年轻人  就像我一个朋友说的 以前过惯了穷日子，觉得那种生活没有什么希望 直到进了币圈儿，心里才多了一种感觉，这种感觉从来没有过 他把这种感觉总结为希望  这些故事的背后是肯定有非常大的风险，但是作为一个底层出身的人来说没有什么特别好的办法赚钱 没有上升通道的年轻人还有什么比币圈儿更让人心潮澎湃的呢？ 但是这些人没有话语权，他们的声音很微弱  勤勤恳恳，老老实实工作的最多温饱，永远不会致富 诚实的人最终也会失望  社会的分配已经严重不公了 互联网更是放大了很多普通人的焦虑，因为看到了太多有钱人的生活，在夜店里豪掷千金，什么BBA都不算豪车了 当下人的欲望已经被无限的放大 人人心中都藏着暴富的魔鬼，可事实上大多数人都是软弱的 你真让他拿血汗钱去博一把又不敢 别人赚钱了他只能拍大腿 别人亏钱了他会哈哈大笑，然后说我早就说这玩意儿不靠谱，以此来显摆他的先见之明。  一个人最恐惧的是未知的事物 最嫉妒的是别人比自己赚的多，别人过的比自己好 一个人最正义凛然的是站在道德制高点去批判指责他人 一个人最喜闻乐见的是自己的异类遭受苦难  所以你看，对于币圈这些事，可以最大的汇集这类人群的恶 他们既没有能力也没有动力去学习区块链的基本知识，有嫉妒记恨币圈儿的人赚到钱 他们无法也不愿意辩证的看待币圈儿一股脑的归类为牛鬼蛇神 有了政策对币圈儿打压，更是仿佛给了他们尚方宝剑，底气更足了，战斗力也更强了  对币圈有反对意见，其实也正常 没有什么新兴事物是不经历这个去芜存箐的过程的 说一千道一万，没必要太去关注 他们怎么说的怎么做的对于历史的车轮是无法阻挡的 我们需要做的，圈内提高认知，扩展资源，圈外提升自己，准备子弹 当然我并不鼓励谁参与任何事，行走江湖需要有自己的认知  自古以来我们就听过苛政猛于虎的道理 能少一分被压迫，多一点机会翻身 穷人是不怕老虎的，相反既得利益者才怕 人生哪里不是韭菜？,2024-03-20T23:51:15,489,80,114

twitter/1725185258935705755,"RT @OccupyDemocrats: BREAKING: Indicted 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump demands that New York judge Arthur Engoron dismiss New York’s $250 million fraud case against him and his family business — and immediately gets a BRUTAL response from Attorney General Letitia James.   Trump told Judge Engoron that the case should be completely dismissed outright because Engoron and his law clerk are “biased” toward him, declaring, “In this case the evidence of apparent and actual bias is tangible and overwhelming. Such evidence, coupled with an unprecedented departure from standard judicial procedure, has tainted these proceedings and a mistrial is warranted.”   Unfortunately for Trump, New York Attorney General Letitia James didn’t mince words with a quick response to Trump’s shameless demand, telling the judge, “Once again, Donald Trump is trying to dismiss the truth and the facts, but the numbers and evidence don’t lie. Donald Trump is now being held accountable for the years of fraud he committed and the incredible ways he lied to enrich himself and his family. He can keep trying to distract from his fraud, but the truth always comes out.”  To make matters even worse for Donald Trump, Judge Engoron ALREADY signaled that he will deny his motion to dismiss the case — and announced today that he will make his final decision on the matter shortly.  Please retweet and hit the ❤️ if you think that Judge Engoron MUST deny Trump’s motion to dismiss the case — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a new pro-democracy social network that is exploding in popularity because Twitter and Facebook are trying to stop its growth — which is only making Tribel grow even faster.

This is all more so the case given that Hizbullah has always credited its performance in the July War, in part, to its primitive telecom network which relied on pagers and a fiber optic 'internal' line. By neutralising Israel's technological superiority with 'simplicity', to borrow Nasrallah's terms, Hizbullah prevented Israel from disrupting its command and control system. 1/",2024-09-18T01:11:26,1912,93,552

Regardless of the veracity of Israel's claims about eliminating Ibrahim Aqil and several Radwan Force commanders, Hizbullah is likely to maintain its current policy of the 'sub-threshold response', adjusting both its tactics and the frequency of its operations according to the integrated terrorist-military-security paradigm Israel has imposed.  Historically, Hizbullah has defined success as the ability to thwart Israel's strategic aims. Given that Israel now views a war with Hizbullah as a strategic end in itself (with the hope of drawing in the US), Hizbullah's approach will likely continue to focus on denying Israel this objective. It will also maintain its refusal to decouple itself from the Palestinian front and persist in denying the normalisation of life in the north, directly countering Israel's strategic objectives.",2024-09-21T02:26:18,1701,113,444

twitter/1851780199454773466,一代股市传奇关善祥跳楼前的自白。 以下是我整理的原文（省流阅读）： 您好，我是关善祥。我知道我已经离开了这个世界。死亡之后，我与A股市场融为一体，我将化为氧气，追逐K线的涨跌。在我闭上眼睛之前，我看到了不同时代的交易员，尼克·莫尔格雷厄姆和罗杰·托马斯·尼尔森，他们一直在讨论我的离去。原来，即使是在另一个世界，人们也喜欢八卦。但我相信，无论身处何种阶层，你们也会好奇，我为什么会选择在今天结束一切。这一切的一切，还得从九十年代说起。 那是我十二岁的时候，我从十二岁开始就跟随炒股的父亲进入了交易大厅，跟着我的父亲。我听到了巴菲特的名字，我迷上了价值投资。经过孜孜不倦的阅读和超前的眼光，我看到了中国房地产的未来。果然，我的眼光总是不错的，我在地产股上面赚了很多，我在二十八岁便实现了财务自由。我想，我应该比绝大部分人都要成功。 后来，我认为投资不过是一场游戏，只要将人性看透了，将规律掌握了，便能将财富赚到手，还能将理念传承下去，便能实现自己的投资理念。那时我可能会被巴菲特邀请与偶像共进晚餐。在我最意气风发的几年里，我萌生了想要将自己的经验传授给他人的想法。我出了一本书，书名我记得好像叫《传世投资》，抱歉，先生，我刚刚来到这个世界，记性有点不好。哦，先生，您是想问我为什么要将书名叫做《传世投资》吗？啊，这很简单，正如其名，我想将自己的投资理念永世流传下去，毕竟投资即人生修行嘛。股票投资的本质就是人生哲学的修行，是践行价值投资之道。 说说我怎么失败的吗？其实失败也很正常，错不在我，错在我选错了市场，选错了赛道。我记得是2017年的一月份，我在恒大五元的时候选择重仓，可不到一年的时间就实现了翻倍。而这让我更加坚定了自己选择的道路。2018年，我选择坚定房地产方向，我认为它一定能够翻倍，所以我又重仓了恒大。我认为，房地产现在处于绝对的价值洼地，高层后续对房地产的政策是不会停的，房地产的扶持也不会止的。因为国内GDP的30%都是地产贡献的，高层又怎能眼睁睁看着自己的亲儿子被葬送呢？我肯定可以通过这笔投资，将自己的名字再次载入史册。可惜事与愿违，我错过了这次高层对房地产动刀的决心，针对房地产的政策一条接一条，许家印也被禁足在了北京城。我管理的基金亏了60%。生平第一次，我有了想哭的冲动。请相信我，先生，这样的亏损足以摧毁我曾经对价值投资的信仰。 在我基金回撤最大的那天，精神差点错乱的那天，我的喉咙里涌出了一股苦涩的味道。百年前的尼弗莫尔好像就站在我面前与我对话。他说，你的心饿了，你犯了所有交易者都会犯的错误，过分相信某一种交易体系。我不知道应该怎么办，但我知道现在的人们会说我是个赌徒，投机客，荒诞愚蠢。可我还知道，无论是投资还是投机，一切都取决于心态。如果一个人的心态是投机的，即便他将钱存在银行拿利息，那也是投机，只不过投机的金额比较小，投机与风险大小无关，只看自己对钱的态度。我不是一个合格的投资者，我的投资都失败了。但这一切都不是价值投资导致的，是我生存的时代来错了市场。我生在一个充斥投机客的市场，一个充满投机氛围的市场。我生在一个对上市公司审查不严苛的市场，一个违规只需要罚酒三杯的市场，一个财务造假只需要几十万便能解决问题的市场。我生在一个不适合做价值投资的市场。 好先生，请不要用可怜的眼神看着我。这不是一个赌徒的忏悔，也不是一个投资者的悲鸣。这是一个股民最后的呐喊。是的，我现在的身份是一个股民，这是一个股民的浪鬼，一个身处下方的股民。即便身处下方，依旧烈日当空，所以我热了多日不眠。所以我困倦已死。所以我去欣赏，我不隐瞒我当下最真实的体验。或许世俗会说，你先找找自己问题吧，甚至我不应该有丝毫责怪市场的意思，可我为什么要让别人指手画脚呢？我的人生以价值赚的第一桶金开始，以价值亏光所有结束。但我亏掉所有不是价值投资本身的错，是市场，是病态的市场。 而在人生的最后一个小时，我想到了小时候，父亲带着我走进交易大厅，那里熙熙攘攘，那里人头攒动，那里是人世间命运的交汇。我走在遍布星光的夜空，感受到了宇宙般温柔的冷漠。正如此时此刻，我感到无比舒适，这是解脱的味道。先生，不论您愿不愿意听，但我都必须说，我过去是幸福的，现在也是幸福的。我的死亡会唤醒无数投资者，因为价值投资已死。,2024-10-31T08:16:18,182,24,51

President Biden is an open book with over 40 years of public service and has released his tax returns for everyone to see. You are wasting tax payers' money on nothing-burger investigations for personal vengeance.   Folks, it is important that we address the issue of Trump's misconduct. I have compiled and personally fact-checked a list of such actions taken by him over the years. Many of them you’ve witnessed or heard from his own mouth. I urge all of you to independently verify each line, and in the event of any inconsistencies, kindly leave a comment.  This is to show he is not a victim of a witch hunt, but rather a repeat offender with disregard for our laws. A man who asked we should “terminate” the constitution so he could overthrow the results of our fair and free elections. Folks who support Mr. Trump, I implore you to consider something. At the end of each item on the aforementioned list, take a moment to pause and imagine if I, President Obama, had taken that same action. How would you feel? What would your reaction be? It is crucial that we acknowledge any double standards that may exist and address them accordingly.  Financial Misconducts: -Trump University: Trump faced a lawsuit for a fraudulent real estate seminar. Settled in 2018, he agreed to pay $25 million to former students. -Trump Foundation: Closed in 2018 by NY authorities for illegal activities, including using charity funds for personal benefit. -Trump SoHo: NYC luxury hotel accused of tax break violations by employing foreign workers. Case pending. -Deutsche Bank: Loaned Trump billions, fined for money laundering. Investigated for potential Trump-Russia ties. -Trump indicted by Manhattan grand jury for $130k hush money to Stormy Daniels pre-2016 election. 34 counts, NY law bookkeeping fraud. Max sentence 136 years if convicted. -Trump's exit: Takes $250m from followers for 'defense' fund, uses it for personal bills. Doesn't help or pardon jailed followers. -Trump investigated for 'valuation fraud': overvaluing properties for loans, undervaluing for tax reduction. If guilty, faces criminal charges, financial penalties, potential public office ban. - His son-in-law, who couldn't even get a security clearance, took $2,000,000,000 (that's 2000 millions) from a foreign government soon as he left office.  Sexual Misconducts: -At least 18 women have accused Donald Trump of varying inappropriate behavior, including allegations of sexual harassment or sexual assault. -Trump answers under oath in E. Jean Carroll lawsuit; she alleges 1990s rape, he denies it. Sued for defamation, trial set for Feb 6. In deposition, used derogatory terms and threatened countersuit. -Woman accusing Trump of raping her at 13 drops lawsuit. Listing Trump and Jefferey Epstein as defendants. Attorney Thomas Meagher files a voluntary dismissal in NY district court. Her attorney, Lisa Boom, cited “numerous threats” against her client. -Trump's vulgar comments about women; the conversation with Billy Bush and Arianne Zucker. Trump admits attempting to have sex with a married woman, mentions her physical changes. -Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful people; I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it.

twitter/1852641541724180763,你想要有钱，必须控制自己！  想要有钱，就必领控制自己 但大部分人都控制不了自己，这就是为什么很多人一辈子也没有钱的原因。  我讲几点，控制自己的心法。  第一、心里只有工作，只管工作，把工作无关的朋友亲戚都戒掉。  第二、习惯性读书，一无聊就读书，养成读书的习惯， 就不会瞎想，从而能够不断 丰富自己的头脑，那些优秀的人的习惯也会不断的洗脑我们，让我们疯狂的工作。  第三、不要接触黄色文化，人接触了黄色文化就很难控制自己了，天天脑袋里就会想很多无聊的东西  第四、强迫自己长跑锻炼身体，这个可以增强自己的意志力，对于控制自己非常有好处。  第五、养成写作习惯，特别是记录自己成功的地方。天天不断地记录自己的成功，就会增加自己的自信，就会让自己越来越成功。  第六、创业或者开公司。一旦你有了自己的事业，你心里面就只有工作了。  因为你要交房租，要给员工发工资，要做业绩，就会把自己逼上健康的道路在这个道路.上你走习惯了，你也就不需要别人控制你了，你自己就把自己控制好其实很多老板都是把自己逼成功的，你不逼自己，你就不知道自己有多优秀。  这就是我控制自己的方法。,2024-11-02T17:18:58,451,59,122

twitter/1655461976599040000,分享一篇文章，名字叫《如何提升学习能力和效率》$URL[0]  文章从大脑神经系统的角度，解释了学习为何物，以及为什么有些人学习半天却没有效果，包括“失败”与“错误”，对学习的帮助。  总结目前自己的错误是：  1、不追求增量学习，只追求一次大幅度的提升。想立刻看到效果，所以会导致我每次开始做都要克服一个心理障碍，因为会觉得要做的事情太多。  2、没有学习目标，只是在被动地经历一些学习活动，纯属“好学但不好奇”，对神经系统没有改变。  「再附一位前辈对文章的评价：  这文章写的很有意思，而我深有同感，我想到现在很多所谓培训机构，就是帮你把各种考试要点给梳理清楚，教你一套应考方法，看似特别醍醐灌顶，有高人指点，好像短时间可以迅速提高，但是其实和学习是背道而驰。  因为在这个知识到应用的过程中，别人都帮你安排好了，知识已经被总结，解题方法也手把手教了，偏偏少了一个试错的过程，少了这个看到问题-思考-不会-找办法-终于解决问题的神经的反馈过程，所以就会导致上了很多培训班，刷了大量习题，下次仍然不会。  如果没刷过什么题，对每一个新问题，都是一个试错的过程，一旦自己解决了，就会印象特别深刻，比别人手把手教了你然后按照同样方法再去做十道题都有用。  知识和能力其实不是教出来的，而是在每次应用的时候试错试出来的。这个试错怎么才最有效，印象最深刻，就成了学习能力最关键的分水岭。」,2023-05-08T14:37:46,606,19,266
twitter/1654458566252859392,【占便宜心态对大脑的影响】  占便宜，很多人理解是通过权力便利、道德绑架占据他人利益的行为。但我想引申来谈一谈，此处的占便宜还包括，赌博等占“运气”便宜的人，还有通过信息差抄袭别人成果的人（我就是受害者之一）。  占便宜行为带来的直接效益就是，通过相对较低的成本享受不可思议的高额回报。正因为有如此显著的高赔率，所以即使概率再低，也有大把大把的人蜂拥而至。  如果是占运气的便宜，则不涉及利益侵占，只是财富或价值的转移与交换，比如赌博和买彩票。如果是占他人的便宜，则涉及到利益的侵占和价值的剽窃，比如洗稿、搬运，可能导致价值原创者不愿再继续创造，最终劣币驱逐良币。  但大多数人对占便宜的理解就到上面为止了，我这次想说的是占便宜对人大脑的影响。  人的大脑就像一个模型，会被外界的输入输出训练，形成一套预测、判断规则，某个预测判断规则如果被多次强化，那么就会不断调整优先权重，将该判断前置，以此来更好的指导自己的行为。  强化的方式，就是正反馈的增大或负反馈的减少。比如，少迟到就能少挨骂，那孩子就会下意识的避免迟到；健身就能受到外界的关注，那就能持续坚持下去。  占便宜同理，当大脑给世界输入一个“抄袭”，世界给大脑还回来一个“关注量”，那被训练的逻辑就成了，input（抄袭）output（关注量），多次强化后，人脑的自动抽象能力启动，最终形成了“占便宜→巨大回报”的判断方式。  这种逻辑的可怕之处在于，大脑已经被这种短平快的想法改造了，因为人脑体验正反馈并不会考虑是否违反“常识、法律、道德等”，只会在一次次刺激下，渴望体验相同的回路，分泌同样的多巴胺，享受快感。  这就是为什么很多人赌博无法“见好就收”，因为他不知道什么是“好”，他只想体验下一次。在熟悉了这种不合理的回报之后，大多数人则无法忍受日常生活中的长期投入和漫漫等待，最终什么事都做不成，只能继续“路径依赖”，做自己原来最喜欢最擅长的，占便宜行为。  就像巴普洛夫的狗，这些人的大脑，会因为想再体验一次大餐，而主动摇起占便宜的铃铛。,2023-05-05T20:10:35,50,2,16

Tobias Hübinette, a senior lecturer in intercultural studies at Karlstad University says for Swedish society, “it’s a pure catastrophe”, because fewer Somalians, Iraqis, and Syrians will come  As an Englishman, I would like to remind Swedes who are persuaded by Holmgren that 72% of Somalians and >30% of Iraqs in Britain live in taxpayer-funded social housing  Studies from Denmark and the Netherlands show these populations commit crimes at 2.5 times the rate of Nordic natives, and are never net tax contributors across their lifetime  These new arrivals are not cultural or economic contributors. They live en masse at the host population's expense  If polite, progressive Sweden can pursue this sensible policy, then surely politicians in the UK can propose we do the same?

Emphasis instead on better integration of legal immigrants here.  * Support for smaller, more local schools. Making use of peripatetic teachers and video relays.  * Push for Dominion Status for Wales ahead of Full Independence. Similar to Ireland's status 1922-49.  Wales desperately needs a better quality of debate  Ahead of Senedd Election 2026.  Hopefully, Gwlad along with the   two other new Welsh parties,   Propel and Sovereign Wales.

twitter/1882543712573809016,"Washington Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde should surely know that her pastoral Accountability is first and foremost to Almighty God‼️  She acted in a manner that belied her PERSONAL, POLITICAL beliefs in defense of SINFULNESS (homosexuality, perversion, witchcraft, pride, etc.).  God help me to be pure in spirit, intention, and ministering.  But GOD will not be mocked!  And this bizarre breach from the pulpit at the expense of the Inaugural Prayer Ceremony merits a rejoinder.  $URL[0]  The most commonly quoted Bible verses are Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13, which state that it is an abomination for a man to lie with another man as he would with a woman.   In Romans 1:26-27, Apostle Paul says that homosexuality is contrary to God's natural order and results from rejecting God.   Additionally,  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 lists homosexuality as one of the sins that will prevent someone from entering the Kingdom of God.   🌟💟  While the Bible is clear in its view of homosexuality, it is essential to remember that God loves all of his creation and offers forgiveness to those who repent and turn away from their sins.  Proverbs 11:2 - When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.  Proverbs 16:5 - Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.  Proverbs 29:23 - A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.  Proverbs 16:18 - Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.  Proverbs 8:13 - The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  Jeremiah 9:23 - Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:",2025-01-24T05:39:31,88,42,10

I don’t think I can live with myself if I don’t try to stop Kamala from doing everything within her power to not only work to make abortion way more accessible but also to force taxpayers to pay for them.  Even if it’s a state issue the will put all of her efforts into making sure this is what states do.   I’m sorry but even though Trump is not with us he won in 2016 and the GOP put the pieces in place and we finally did get RvW overturned.  Trump is not with us on creating a culture that respects human life but he will not push abortion like she will.  This means pro-lifers can work to rid our country of this abomination of evil regardless.

twitter/1902087469761491296,"Just a few interesting reactions to Trump’s call with Putin from the Russian side:  “Let's say the last thing about the 'historic negotiations', as a result of which the Russian Federation will probably lose to the USA at hockey.  The 'agreements' reached are complete crap. Trump made a fool of himself by promising to resolve the conflict. Just yesterday he announced about an upcoming call: 'I think Russia will agree.' But it turned out that desire alone is not enough.  Recall that Ukraine agreed to the US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. Kyiv declared that the “puck” is in Russia's court.  And so Trump calls Russia. And Russia tells him: let's play hockey and create negotiating groups. Cool? Cool.   While the hockey players play and the negotiators endlessly discuss the Kremlin's obviously impossible demands to limit the Ukrainian army, the war will continue.  Trump refused to hold a press conference after the conversation. He himself understands that he screwed up.  The stock market responded by falling numbers. Trump's rating will soon follow. When in six months, a year and beyond absolutely nothing will change, questions will arise about him, and that will be absolutely logical.”  - From TG channel “Агрегатор Правды”  “A significant conversation about hockey and a little bit about the khokhols, or whatever is going on in high offices?  Putin rejected the idea of ​​a 30-day ceasefire and rightly so. Giving a tired enemy a break would be a crime.  But. Putin decided to release a couple dozen prisoners of war free of charge as a 'gesture of goodwill.'   Among other things, Putin got pressured by his Western master and said, forgetting about his own recent promise to kill terrorists, that the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Kursk could calmly surrender and enjoy life.  Well, and a somewhat degraded deal did happen. Not in the 'Minsk' format, but in a mutual cessation of bombing of energy infrastructure. Will Zelensky play this game? We'll check after another raid by khokhol drones.  The only positive outcome of the negotiations: Putin's position that the foreign aid to Ukraine has to be stopped. But unilateral concessions will not contribute to this in any way.  Putin has turned out to be somewhat contradictory. Apparently, he is nervous in the presence of big guys. But we talked about hockey and 'economic cooperation' - that's the main thing.”  - From TG channel “Прямое действие Z”  “Overall, the reports of the telephone conversation from both sides look as if the US is not a party to the conflict, but is merely carrying in its peace dove’s beak the messages from the Russian side to the Ukrainian side and back.   There was even time to discuss hockey. I think that including such an item on the agenda along with questions about the fate of the front will cause special joy among our front-line soldiers.”  - Nikita Tretyakov  Continued below 🔽",2025-03-19T03:59:26,48,5,18

HB25-1073, which would have required prison time instead of probation for rap*sts, was shut down by Democrats. Under current law, s*xual predators can receive just 10 to 20 years to life on probation. The bill sought to impose indeterminate prison sentences from 2 to 4 year in prison to life for anyone convicted of these horrific crimes against minors.  DISGUSTING!  As of today 70% of those convicted of s*xually assaulting a child receive PROBATION—no prison time. Of the few who are imprisoned, 73% are paroled after serving an average of just 8 years. Under current sentencing laws, no one has ever served more than 25 years for these atrocious crimes.",2025-03-18T09:46:05,0,0,898

twitter/1840137940497994073,我實在看不懂，中文圈有那麼多人居然認為：紐約市長亞當斯是因為反對非法移民而被內部整肅。 我有理由認為這是中共故意混淆是非。 2022年紐約選舉時，紐約的中共代理人公開宣稱：不管民主黨、共和黨、白人黑人華人，都是我們的人！ 亞當斯就是最典型的中共控制的美國政客！ 我記得在紐約福建人開辦中共非法警所時，亞當斯還給長樂公會盧建旺頒發紐約市長獎！這時距離盧建旺被FBI抓捕只有兩個月。 下圖是2022年10月1日，亞當斯出席中共慶典。他的左側是中共紐約領事黃屏，他的右側是他的華裔高級顧問鄭琪蓉！（這個紅色的鄭琪蓉高級顧問已經足以說明亞當斯的政治光譜）！ 亞當斯2022年當選市長以後，第一件事就是竭力推行《非公民投票法案》（Our City，Our Vote Act)。這個法案規定：在紐約住滿30天就有投票權。亞當斯宣稱有80萬非公民（其中有近12萬來自中國的非法移民）都可以到市政廳投票。這充分說明亞當斯根本不反對非法移民。 好在這個毀滅美國憲政的極左瘋狂法案，最後被紐約高院判決違憲而結束。否則中共再輸入足夠多的非法移民，紐約就真的成了中共殖民地！ 問題是亞當斯執行的恰恰就是現在哈瑪斯這些極左的政策。所以亞當斯只是一個縮小版的哈里斯而已。 對紐約司法系統不斷抓捕中共間諜、抓捕在政府部門的中共代理人，我是特別讚賞的。 當年紐約高院否定亞當斯的非法移民投票案，以及現在的注意到中共長期滲透而實施的一系列FBI行動。其實證明一點：美國並沒有被極左和中共完全佔領。美國的良知還在。即使在極左瘋狂之下，正直的美國人還是在維護美國的安全！ 這就是美國的希望所在。 現在，不要一說紐約的行動就直接歸為左派內鬥！至少紐約最近幾次抓出的中共代理，沒有一個抓錯的。包括亞當斯！,2024-09-29T05:14:07,20,5,10

twitter/1818804905207120341,"RT @kevinkfyam: A number of thoughts/observations:  1. Don’t blame the overseas students who come with limited English abilities. If they are being let in, why wouldn’t they come?  2. In my dealings with Chinese speaking overseas students, they are often pretty bright when you talk to them in Chinese - it’s when they have to use English that they suddenly become “illiterate”.  3. For all sorts of reasons, and with the exceptions of certain world famous faculties in certain universities, Australian universities are often considered (unfairly in my view) as the (relatively) cheap and cheerful option which would not be the first choice for typical overseas students. They would tend to prefer to go to UK, US or even Canada, and it’s Australia’s lower IELTS requirements and relatively lower fees that keep the Australian tertiary sector competitive.   4. But I would not blame universities for lowering their standards to bring in more overseas students. They are starved of public funding after decades of bipartisan cuts (in real, inflation adjusted terms), and for even the top universities in Australia, they face a real problem with rich people in Australia being much more stingy with university endowments for top universities compared with their counterparts in Europe and North America. As an aside, this dire funding situation doesn’t just affect the quality of overseas students we bring in, there’s also a national security issue at play here: institutions linked with authoritarian governments do help plug the research funding shortfalls in Australia, and of course they wouldn’t give something for nothing!  5. As such, rather than demonising the overseas students who are let in despite struggling with English, or the universities that let them (and funding linked with authoritarians) in, why don’t we demand instead that both Labor and the Coalition would commit to substantially increasing higher education funding, and that our rich people learn a thing or two from their European and North American counterparts about being less stingy with their wealth?",2024-08-01T08:24:15,0,0,30

twitter/1864830481843548605,RT @gtranslatornfsc: 【秘翻在线】美参议员听取中共黑客攻击情况汇报后誓言采取行动  据《路透社》（Reuters）12月5日报道，美国政府机构周三（12月4日）为全体 #参议员 举行了一次机密简报会，内容涉及中共涉嫌通过“#盐台风”（#SaltTyphoon）深入 #美国电信公司 并窃取美国通话数据。  有关官员告诉路透社，#联邦调查局（#FBI）、国家情报总监艾薇儿·海恩斯（Avril Haines）、联邦通信委员会主席杰西卡·罗森沃塞尔（Jessica Rosenworcel）、#国家安全委员会（National Security Council）和网络安全与基础设施安全局（Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency）等机构参加了这次闭门简报会。  民主党参议员罗恩·怀登（Ron Wyden）在简报会后告诉记者，他正在起草有关这一问题的 #立法，而参议员鲍勃·凯西（Bob Casey）表示，他对这一泄密事件“非常担忧”，并补充说，国会可能要到明年才能解决这个问题。  共和党参议员里克·斯科特（Rick Scott）对简报表示失望。他说：“他们没有告诉我们为什么他们没有发现；他们本可以做些什么来阻止其发生。”  另外，参议院商务小组委员会将于12月11日就 “盐台风”举行听证会，讨论“安全威胁如何对我们的通信网络构成风险并审查最佳做法”。竞争运营商协会（Competitive Carriers Association）首席执行官蒂姆·多诺万（Tim Donovan）将出席听证会。  一位白宫高级官员12月4日表示，#中共 #黑客 通过入侵电信公司来监视美国公民的短信和电话，其规模远远超出了公众此前的认知。人们对所报道的 #中共黑客 入侵美国电信网络的规模和范围愈发担忧，以及企业和政府何时才能就此事向美国人作出保证。  网络间谍活动能使黑客访问多种类型的信息，包括大量通话记录、某些特定电话的访问权限，以及电信公司与执法和情报机构合作，并根据法院命令访问目标信息的系统。  美国国家安全委员会负责网络和新兴技术的副国家安全顾问安妮·纽贝格（Anne Neuberger）表示，“在这场大规模的网络间谍活动中，大量美国人的元数据被盗，全球有数十家公司遭到黑客攻击，其中包括至少八家美国电信和电信基础设施公司。高级黑客团队可以长期潜伏在庞大计算机网络的偏僻角落。美国并不认为任何一家美国电信公司已经完全清除了这些黑客。在美国公司解决网络安全漏洞之前，通信会持续受到威胁。中共（黑客）可能会继续获得访问权限。”  参议员理查德·布卢门撒尔（Richard Blumenthal）表示：“中共黑客攻击的范围、深度和广度绝对令人难以置信——我们竟然允许去年发生那样多的事情，这太可怕了！”  即将上任的联邦通信委员会主席布伦丹·卡尔（Brendan Carr）12月4日表示，他将“在过渡期间和明年与国家安全机构合作，努力根除威胁并保护我们的网络。”  美国官员此前曾声称，黑客针对威瑞森（Verizon）、AT&T、德国电信（T-Mobile）、流明（Lumen）等公司，窃取电话音频拦截以及大量通话记录数据。  德国电信公司表示，它不相信黑客能够获取其客户信息。流明公司称，没有证据表明其网络上的客户数据被访问。威瑞森公司称，“几周前，我们意识到一个非常老练的国家行为者进入了美国几家电信公司的网络，包括威瑞森”，并补充说该事件仅针对政府和政界的一小部分人。AT&T表示，它“正在与联邦执法部门、行业同行和网络安全专家密切合作，以识别和补救对我们网络的任何影响。”  12月3日，美国及其主要盟友澳大利亚、加拿大和新西兰的机构发布了一份公共指南，帮助电信公司保护自己免受中共黑客的侵害。  网络安全与基础设施安全局告诉记者，它无法提供清除美国电信网络所有黑客的时间表。该机构官员Jeff Greene说：“我们不可能预测何时才能完全清除黑客。”,2024-12-06T08:33:28,0,0,20

twitter/1854412862149853661,"RT @KonstantinKisin: For my British and European friends who are 'shocked' and 'surprised', here are 10 reasons you didn't see this coming.   Read this short post and then read the replies from our American friends who will confirm what I'm saying.   1. Americans love their country and want it to be the best in the world. America is a nation of people who conquered a continent. They love strength. They love winning. Any leader who appeals to that has an automatic advantage.  2. Unlike Europeans, Americans have not accepted managed decline. They don't have Net Zero here, they believe in producing their own energy and making it as cheap as possible because they know that their prosperity depends on it.  3. Prices for most basic goods in the US have increased rapidly and are sky high. What the official statistics say about inflation and the reality of people's lives are not the same.  4. Unlike you, Americans do not believe in socialism. They believe in meritocracy. They don't care about the super rich being super rich because they know that they live in a country where being super rich is available to anyone with the talent and drive to make it. They don't resent success, they celebrate it.  5. Americans are the most pro-immigration people in the world. Read that again. Seriously, read it again. Americans love an immigrant success story. They want more talented immigrants to come to America. But they refuse to accept people coming illegally. They believe in having a border.   6. Americans are sensitive about racial issues and their country's imperfect history. They believe that those who are disadvantaged by the circumstances of their birth should be given the opportunity to succeed. What they reject, however, is the idea that in order to address the errors of the past new errors must be made. DEI is racist. They know it and they reject it precisely because they are not racist.  7. Americans are the most philosemitic nation on earth. October 7 and the pro-Hamas left's reaction shocked them to their very core because, among other things, they remember what 9/11 was like and they know jihad when they see it.  8. Americans are extremely practical people. They care about what works, not what sounds good. In Europe, we produce great writers and intellectuals. In America they produce (and attract) great engineers, businessmen and investors. Because of this, they care less about Trump's rhetoric than you do and more about his policies than you do.  9. Americans are deeply optimistic people. They hate negativity. The woke view of American history as a series of evils for which they must eternally apologise is utterly abhorrent to them. They believe in moving forward together, not endlessly obsessing about the past.  10. America is a country whose founding story is one of resistance to government overreach. They loathe unnecessary restrictions, regulations and control. They understand that freedom comes with the price of self-reliance and they pay it gladly.",2024-11-07T14:37:34,0,0,37032

twitter/1738430809156243563,"A “blow to nuclear” I can live with.  The Biden administration has decided to go stringent on additionality when it comes to clean hydrogen producers. What this means is you’re not getting paid that sweet sweet IRA money unless you can show you’re bringing on additional low carbon power to make that hydrogen.  The reason it’s a blow to nuclear: none of the existing plants are going to be able to partake and new nuclear facilities are likely too far out to benefit. The nuclear industry is going to miss out for the most part.  Who is going to benefit? This is a huge shot in the arm for advanced geothermal, such as @fervoenergy. Since it’s just popping off the timing is great and it is the 24/7 power needed to make electrolyzers properly productive.   What I’m wondering: would a life-extension that wouldn’t otherwise happen qualify as additional? What about uprates of existing facilities? And if the owner of a nuclear plant wants to take advantage of the base load to make H2 can they bring on a bunch of cheap solar in another state to satisfy additionality?  Lots of questions yet to be answered but the bottom line is this: it’s time for the nuclear industry to deliver on new capacity. No new capacity, no credits is tough but fair. $URL[0]",2023-12-23T13:26:18,55,11,4

twitter/1862027145511612757,20241128 德國版馬英九出回憶錄  在德國執政16年的德國梅大媽，最近出了回憶錄，為她執政期間的種種決定辯護。在我看，梅克爾就是德國版的馬英九。她的執政可以用四句話概括：能源靠俄國，安全靠美國，經濟靠中國，勞工靠土國（土耳其）。整體而言，梅克爾就是一個搞死德國的買辦而已。  她的回憶錄裡面講，普丁大帝知道梅大媽怕狗，俄德峰會就給她放狗在旁邊跑，但是為了德國的利益，她還是跟俄羅斯把便宜的天然氣合約給簽了。在這過程中，她把德國的能源安全完全拋諸腦後。  在政治分岐沒有解決的情況下，德國的國家安全卻又全部放給美國，儘管2018年在G7峰會被川普駡沒有承擔保衛自己的責任，梅大媽依然故我，梅大媽卸任總理後，世人才發現，先前兩次在歐洲發動大戰的德軍，10台坦克能動的不到一台。  梅大媽的問題還不只於此，在任期間拼命衝中國外銷，2019年前連續四年成為全球第一順差國，其中對中國的出口大幅成長是關鍵，看似風光無限，但是細看德國的出口項目，多是製造機械等資本財項目，中國拿到這些機器後，轉變成低價取代德國製造的生產設備。此後，中國還需要德國的貨品嗎？  德系汽車廠在2024年第三季業績全是崩潰。Volkswagen，淨利暴跌64%；Audi，淨利暴跌91%；BMW，淨利暴跌84%；Benz，淨利暴跌54%。這都是德國最頂尖的企業，全部深陷中國的泥沼，為何？因為梅大媽從來不知道：戒急用忍真的很重要！  最後，為了應付德國勞動力的短缺，梅克爾的辦法簡單粗暴，大量接收土耳其與穆斯林移民，中間忽略了與德國社會的適應過程，30年幾乎聽不到的強姦強暴案件現在在德國到處都出現。德國治安的全面惡化與梅克爾執政的16年脫不了關係。  德國能怎麼辦？我也不知道，但是全面檢討梅克爾時代的種種買空賣空的政策應該是必經的過程。這概念就像中國面對文革一樣，不去徹底否定，過幾年文革時代成長的人又會把國家導回文革的方向。面對梅克爾也是如此，不去否定梅克爾忽略能源安全、國防安全、貿易安全以及社會安全的政策，德國也將走不出當下投機不成的困境。  看看德國，回想台灣，幸好2014年我們有一場太陽花，阻止了馬英九全面向中國傾斜的政策，也幸好有一票半導體義勇軍，在當時阻止了紫光的收購。這差別在哪裡？人民的反省能力！台灣人知道要擋下馬英九的傾中，但是德國人似乎直到今天，好像還不知道梅克爾的種種禍害。以這個角度看，身為臺灣人確實是可以小小驕傲一下；而德國的長期失落，也將難以避免。,2024-11-28T14:54:00,682,27,118

They are breaking the law, I don’t need to tell you that.  They need to be sent the Marshals and get arrested, as they will ignore the Judges’ ruling.  They will try to fire them and impeach them.

It’s Putin’s play book.  I told you so. @JoeBiden   Trump’s orders are illegal, and unconstitutional. Trump is likely in violation of the TROs suspending his funding freeze as we speak, but the Trump-aligned media refuses to inform the public.   Insurmountable Constitutional Crisis:  “In theory, these orders should be effective stopgaps. The problem is that the court has no enforcement mechanism. It has no army, no police force, no power to impose its will. Instead, the executive—in this case the president—is supposed to enforce the court’s orders.” —and that is the biggest problems. The thugs are the ones with all the powers.   The only thing that could be done is if Democrats and Republicans and members of the Armed forces get together and empower Marshals, a faction of the armed forces, and send them, embolden to fulfill the rule of law and arrest them.

Through sharp analysis that cuts through the noise, Bender and Hanna dismantle exaggerated mythologies about AI technologies, what we think its many forms may be capable of, and their influence on society.  👀 Learn how to spot AI hype, how to deconstruct it and how to expose the power grabs it aims to hide.

Basically, he's saying it's pretty reckless to reject the vaccine.  He didn't stop there. He took a jab (pun intended) at Cardinal Raymond Burke, who was against the shots but ended up hospitalized with COVID. Francis basically said, 'See, even some of the big shots among the bishops got hit hard.'  And he's not thrilled about how some folks spread fear and confusion about the vaccines. You know, saying stuff like there are microchips in the shots or claiming it's just water in those vials. He thinks all that talk just made people freak out.  But, he's been a big supporter of the jabs from the get-go. He sees them as a game-changer in this whole pandemic mess.

While some Jewish individuals were involved in the Bolshevik movement, it's inaccurate to characterize the Bolsheviks as predominantly Jewish or to suggest a 'Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy'.   Jews were overrepresented in the Bolshevik ranks compared to their percentage in the wider population, but this was also true for other groups, such as Latvians and Caucasians. Bolshevism was a Political Ideology, not a religious or ethnic movement.   Historical Context: The Russian Revolution and the subsequent rise of Bolshevism occurred in a context of widespread anti-Semitism in Russia and Europe.   Jews never made up the majority of the Bolsheviks: The Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) on the eve of October 1917 had 20% Jews (6 out of 30), and in the first composition of the political bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) – 40% (3 out of 7).",2025-03-18T03:29:46,70,87,0

No. They’ll come up with some answer to that also someday.”  - Lauren Boebert got caught vaping and groping her boyfriend in a public theater and was kicked out.  - At the FRC Action conference, Trump announced that he’s currently beating Obama in the polls.  - At the same FRC conference Trump said if elected he will stop World War II.  - On Sunday’s Meet the Press, Trump said he would compromise with Democrats on abortion, and that a heartbeat bill is a “terrible thing”.  - Kevin McCarthy endorsed Donald Trump for President.",2023-09-18T20:29:46,690,79,192

twitter/1905126031272657136,"A friend owns a small sporting goods store in Bangalore. Regardless of the government in place, he and other businesses around him are forced to pay lakhs in bribes. Lakhs.  Someone from the Department of Metrology will come in one day. Go through EVERY item in stock so they can find something where the label has fallen off or is less visible. They ask that it’s okay for them to give him a court date so he can resolve it. Or he can pay a “fine”.  In a few days, the Department of Labour comes in. They will come with several people and go through every book and registration. Find something to blackmail him about. Then ask for a fine. Mind you, this is a person that is a stickler for transparency and is very organised.  Then there is the GST audit. The slabs are very weird here. It goes from 2.5% to 18% even though everything is sports. They will find one entry in a thousand within the inventory and repeat threat of courts.  A businessman close by to his store told them no, they couldn’t do this and even he had political reach. They gave him a date to resolve it in court where he spent months trying to respond to the summons. Unsure which department it was for.  Then there is the trade licence. They need an NOC from everyone about the business. They can go and ask people in the neighbourhood if they are okay with the footfall or if it gets too noisy. If they can frame anything as a complaint, they do.  There are well-known characters in the process. A man, well-dressed, well-known to businesses across town, makes lakhs in a day. He sits at the store and does not budge until he finds something. Keeps conversation light. Finds something. Asks to be paid.  Add here the random drop-ins by the cops who tale away goods worth thousands for 200 because “if something happens, like the lock on your shutter door is broken or your store is vandalised, you will need us. Help us out for now.” That is a hardly veiled threat.  This is understood to be normal. This needs to change.",2025-03-27T13:13:36,9619,1721,2669

twitter/1861684302414586307,"COUNTERFEIT Dollars MEGA SCARE, is a prelude to a broad banking deposit BAIL IN'S and bank collapse. We have stated, media & dark state will suddenly highlight a huge FAKE Dollar cash crime syndicates of epidemic scale.  Its purpose will be to:  1. Flush cash hoards into the banks, for sanitisation [scanning] due to loss of confidence in dollars, potentially for later rug pull on all deposits  1 a. Many counterfeiters may be discovered to be 'chosen ones' operators or backed by them, and will have got away with billions of fiat dilution profits  2. Do a subsequent tax enquiries and extraction on the fiat washed back in to banks in event of [1] above   3. Undermine confidence in cash [Primary goal]  4. Present the counterfeiting as at a 'nation state level sophisticated' [They hate our democracy, so they now attack our money, dam Chinese! Drug Cartels etc..!].   Also ensure it is perceived as vast and almost a futile counter enforcement issue, without having to go to WAR, with a nation state(s) collaborators, blaming not criminals but entire nations, China, South American nations of being virtually deeply endemically involved.  5. They will later claim the 're-banking' of legitimate 'illicit' notes, has had the benefits of being a great rounding up of 'Money launderers' & 'Tax avoiders'.  6. Followed by another media blitz of how large the money laundering issue has proven. How unfair it is to others [we are all in this together, time to kill the cheats once and for all].   That its time to 'think the unthinkable', 'be radical', in prevention of these waves of criminality. In fact 'Cash' is a relic of a world that no longer exists.   That most payments of size are done electronically by percentage, so its really just in some ways 'petty' transaction money, scaled in nature only by criminals and dogers.   State that technology has advanced and costs for these small transactions, in the banking system can now be done also for free, 'digitally' below a certain amount.   The informal sector must not be allowed to mask their transactions and activities, great gains in enforcement of crime will be gained by digitalisation, given lower resources.  7. Everyone therefore needs a digital ID, and a digital Point of sale [PoS] device/software on their phone for whatever services they provide, right down to a gardener.  8. Auto tax extraction will occur at PoS, on all categorised income, reducing all businesses to an assumptions based model of 'Pay as You Earn'. with limited acceptable expense reclaims at year ends.   9. AI based 'Fast TAX' systems will be launched, making your life 'easier and admin free',  and uploaded to the blockchain. Where it is reviewable by any authority with a licence to view.  10. Given the blockchain is reviewable by all, some clearance levels encryption will be involved. But despite this a spate of small/medium business 'revenue or profit doxing', will occur causing localised citizen envy. Keep the people fighting amongst themselves like crabs in a bucket.   11. Shouts of how these relative wealthy successful people should pay more given the 'plight' of the everyday man!   Which leads to more Socialisim => towards inching to full blown income levelling into communism, as a list of 'unlucky' financial crisis's keep befalling, and government pleads insufficient revenue to maintain existing services, after a period of decay on roads, infrastructure, pension collapses.

twitter/1698649416687657425,"I'm shocked this documentary is still up on YouTube. It's a must watch.  Vaccination: The Hidden Truth  Vaccination: The Hidden Truth (1998) In this extremely informative video, fifteen people, including Dr. Viera Scheibner (a PhD researcher), five medical doctors, other researchers, reveal what is really going on in relation to illness and vaccines.   Ironically, the important facts come from the orthodox medicine's own peer-reviewed research. With so much government and medical promotion of vaccination for prevention of disease, the video is clearly devoted to presenting the other side of the issue that parents and others are not being told. The result is a damning account of the ineffectiveness of vaccines and their often harmful effects.   It declares that parents are not being told the truth by the media, the Health Department and the medical establishment, with a medical doctor, Dr. Mark Donohoe, confessing that 'It is a problem for me that I am part of a profession that is systematically lying to people...' The video presents well documented answers to questions like: Was it really vaccines that saved us? Why are they only counterproductive? How are many statistics misleading? What do vaccines contain? What are they doing to our organs, immune systems, even our genes? Are childhood diseases really dangerous to healthy children? Why does vaccination continue? What are our rights? Can vaccine damage be evaluated and countered? What is the true key to immunity?   The video raises the fundamental question of whether we should be trying to prevent childhood diseases anyway, in that they contribute to the development of a healthy immune system. If what the video says is true, why is vaccination pushed so heavily by the government authorities?   In the video, Dr. Viera Scheibner, who has studied almost 100,000 pages of orthodox medical research on vaccination, warns: 'It took almost three years of research before we looked at each other and said 'Vaccines are killing babies'... It is a well documented fact that the incidence and mortality from infectious diseases fell by 90% well before any vaccine was even introduced.'   And this from Dr. Archie Kalokerinos, author of the book 'Every Second Child': 'So it was obvious that I, and every other doctor for that matter, had been grossly misled... It was clearly shown that the only people who got smallpox twice were the vaccinated.' If you are in the frustrating position of wanting to inform your spouse, friends and/or relatives about vaccination, but they won't read appropriate literature, then this video is ideal. It is clear and logical and an eye-opener. Every doctor should see and respond to it.  Link below 👇",2023-09-04T18:49:14,600,14,267

He’s not a dealmaker—he’s a deal-killer, a lying sack of shit who gambles with our money and loses every time. That 54% tariff didn’t give him power; it gave him a bigger mess. China’s not budging, TikTok’s slipping away, and Americans are stuck with the tab. “Great power to negotiate”? More like great power to fuck us all while he preens for the cameras.    This isn’t about national security or data privacy—it’s about Trump’s ego. He’s still pissy about TikTok kids trolling his Tulsa rally, so he’s torching the economy for revenge. Petty, pathetic, and peak Trump. April 5’s coming, and he’ll have nothing but excuses—probably blame Biden, Obama, or a random intern. Meanwhile, the rest of us are cleaning up his mess, paying more, and watching this tariff tantrum crash and burn. Trump’s not a negotiator; he’s a narcissist with a grudge and a hard-on for failure.

Here is a list of all 14:  In the first video: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.” $URL[0]  In the second video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, “I want a Lamborghini” as she negotiated the best price for baby parts. $URL[1]  In the third video: Holly O’Donnell, a former Stem Express employee who worked inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, detailed first-hand the unspeakable atrocities and how she fainted in horror over handling baby legs. $URL[2]  In the fourth video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Savita Ginde stated, “We don’t want to do just a flat-fee (per baby) of like, $200. A per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.” She also laughed while looking at a plate of fetal kidneys that were “good to go.” $URL[3]  In the fifth video: Melissa Farrell of Planned Parenthood-Gulf Coast in Houston boasted of Planned Parenthood’s skill in obtaining “intact fetal cadavers” and how her “research” department “contributes so much to the bottom line of our organization here, you know we’re one of the largest affiliates, our Research Department is the largest in the United States.” $URL[4]  In the sixth video: Holly O’Donnell described technicians taking fetal parts without patient consent: “There were times when they would just take what they wanted. And these mothers don’t know. And there’s no way they would know.” $URL[5]  In the seventh and perhaps most disturbing video: Holly O’Donnell described the harvesting, or “procurement,” of organs from a nearly intact late-term fetus aborted at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte’s Alameda clinic in San Jose, CA. “‘You want to see something kind of cool,’” O’Donnell says her supervisor asked her. “And she just taps the heart, and it starts beating. And I’m sitting here and I’m looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think.” $URL[6]  In the eighth video: StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer admits Planned Parenthood sells “a lot of” fully intact aborted babies. $URL[7]  The ninth video: catches a Planned Parenthood medical director discussing how the abortion company sells fully intact aborted babies — including one who “just fell out” of the womb. $URL[8]  The 10th video: catches the nation’s biggest abortion business selling specific body parts — including the heart, eyes and “gonads” of unborn babies. The video also shows the shocking ways in which Planned Parenthood officials admit that they are breaking federal law by selling aborted baby body parts for profit. $URL[9]  Unreleased Videos: Unreleased videos from CMP show Deb Vanderhei of Planned Parenthood caught on tape talking about how Planned Parenthood abortion business affiliates may “want to increase revenue [from selling baby parts] but we can’t stop them…” Another video has a woman talking about the “financial incentives” of selling aborted baby body parts. $URL[10]  The 11th video: catches a Texas Planned Parenthood abortionist planning to sell the intact heads of aborted babies for research. Amna Dermish is caught on tape describing an illegal partial-birth abortion procedure to terminate living, late-term unborn babies which she hopes will yield intact fetal heads for brain harvesting. $URL[11]  The 12th video in the series shows new footage of Jennefer Russo, medical director at Planned Parenthood in Orange County, California, describing to undercover investigators how her abortion business tries to harvest intact aborted babies’ bodies for a local for-profit biotech company and changes the abortion procedure to do so. $URL[12]  The 13th video: exposes a Planned Parenthood medical director admitting that babies born alive after abortion are sometimes killed. $URL[13]  The 14th video: catches Planned Parenthood executives discussing gruesome abortion procedures and the sale of body parts from aborted babies for profit. $URL[14]  src: $URL[15]",2023-12-03T07:52:38,455,15,214

twitter/1919151553048359277,"So, a bit of nuance here - most new policies, including DEI ones, are implemented by existing leadership or absorbed into the responsibilities of current teams. It’s extremely rare for someone to be hired solely to deliver a single policy - meaning these tasks usually fall to existing staff, making them de facto volunteers in all but name.  The idea of bringing in someone externally to implement policies on a voluntary basis might sound appealing on paper, but it comes with significant pitfalls. The biggest of them is accountability: who do they answer to? What happens if something goes wrong? And how do you ensure consistency, alignment with organisational values, or even basic data protection compliance?  Policy isn’t just a set of tasks to tick off. It’s about culture change, follow-through, and sustained oversight - none of which can be reliably delivered by someone with no contractual obligation to the organisation.",2025-05-05T06:06:01,5,0,0

twitter/1841146085861155287,"The Blob in Washington has been secretly encouraging Israel to start a war with Iran, while publicly calling for them to deescalate.  Vice President Harris, there’s no joy in your Administration lying to the world about helping stoke WWIII.  But then again, Dick Cheney and your 700 other defense industry endorsers were never in it for the vibes.  Look, my friends. You may dislike President Trump’s style of speaking, but he led this country for four years without a single new major war anywhere on Earth. More people died from conflict around the world in the first two years of Biden/Harris than in all four years of Donald J. Trump combined.   Those who reflexively loathe Trump seem to dismiss this record of peace as a fluke, while simultaneously mocking Trump for holding diplomatic dialogues with our global adversaries. As though the two are somehow unrelated.  But let’s be clear. War is hell. War is a racket. War does not “uplift working people” or help them “get ahead, not just get by.” War drives inflation through the roof, disrupts supply chains around the world, diverts taxpayer money to bombs, sends parents away from their families to fight, and robs civilians of their homes, their limbs, and their lives. War yields multi-decade economic disruption and multi-generational trauma.  We face today the choice between a leader who talks tough while keeping the peace and a leader who talks pretty while making secret plans to plunge the world into war.  Please, for the love of our children, cast your vote based on candidates’ actions, not based on their speechwriters’ words.  $URL[0]",2024-10-02T00:00:08,5042,235,1512

twitter/1839573016398721384,"I’d like to just say this unequivocally   THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT ME  I know there are so many people who support Israel but who are afraid to speak up. There is no reason to fear speaking the truth. If you have something to say on it, go for it!   It’s a duty to do so because lies and complicity in lies is an affront to existence, to reality and to G’d.  If you support Israel and want a boost send me your post and I’ll share it and ask people follow you. We should all follow each other and support each other.   Tips:  Talk to people.  Most people on here are willing to chat, ask to join DM groups. DM me or others who are active in trying to counter the tsunami of hate And see what aspect of it you might like to focus on.  Write original content.  You don’t need to be a brilliant writer. What you feel as a human during these days matters. Write from the heart.  People respond to truth and honesty.  Do not fear the mob.  They are cowards.  Once you’ve been threatened a few times you realise these are just flesh covered balls of hate and fury.  They say terrible things but it’s words and our words actually do make a difference to people who so need the support right now.  Stand with us, shout with us. #Peace #England #Israel",2024-09-27T15:49:19,93,19,24

twitter/1843792929145683988,RT @koike_akira: 「れいわ」による沖縄１区擁立は、あかみね政賢議員の再選に敵対し、「オール沖縄」の団結を破壊する行為  れいわ新選組は８日の記者会見で「オール沖縄」のあかみね政賢候補に対抗する形で、衆院沖縄１区への候補者擁立を発表しました。  私は今日、緊急に記者会見を行い、れいわの候補擁立は、あかみね氏再選に敵対するのみならず、「辺野古新基地反対」で団結してきた「オール沖縄」の取り組みへの破壊行為だと厳しく抗議しました。  私は、「あかみね氏は、日本共産党の唯一の小選挙区選出議員であるだけでなく、沖縄を代表する政治家だ。辺野古新基地建設の問題点を繰り返し追及し、南西諸島へのミサイル配備にも、米兵の性暴力にも、県民の怒りをぶつけ、県民のくらしと経済を支えるためにも奮闘してきた、党派を超えた『宝の議席』だ」と述べました。  その上で、今月２日、れいわの高井崇志幹事長が、「沖縄１区に候補者擁立の準備をしている｣と伝えてきたこと、そして東京１４区、神奈川２区と、高井氏自身が立候補する埼玉１４区での「候補者調整」を要請してきたことを明らかにしました。  その際に私は、「申し出には応じられない」と返答し、「山本太郎代表は野党共闘しないと繰り返し表明してきたのに、筋が通らないではないか」と指摘しました。そして、「あかみね氏は日本共産党の現職議員であるだけでなく、次期総選挙でも『オール沖縄』の代表として、全体の議論で確認された候補者だ」として、｢その合意を破壊することは許されない｣と通告しました。あわせて、「れいわは、沖縄でこれまで行われてきた『４区候補者選定会議』に出席してきたが、１区のことには一言も触れてこなかった」と指摘したことも明らかにし、「辺野古新基地建設にも、南西諸島の軍事要塞化にも、最も厳しく対決してきた共産党のあかみね氏に対抗馬を立てることは、二重三重に筋が通らない」と批判しました。  高井氏は、「総選挙近し」の情報が流れた昨年６月にも、私に対して沖縄１区、東京２０区、京都１区、大阪５区で候補者を決定したと伝え、候補者調整を求めてきました。これは、日本共産党が重視していた選挙区に対する｢狙い撃ち｣とも言うべきやり方でしたが、その際にも私は、「どの選挙区に候補者を立てるかは、れいわの判断だが、沖縄１区への擁立は、共産党のみならず、オール沖縄全体への敵対行為になる」と警告し、当時「オール沖縄」陣営にれいわの申し出を伝えたところ、当然ながら強い怒りが沸き上がったことも述べました。  以上述べた上で私は、「オール沖縄」の団結を強め、沖縄一区での、あかみね必勝へ、全力を尽くす決意を表明しました。,2024-10-09T07:17:44,0,0,1675

So if you claim the sun and moon were already made before day 1, or even on day 1 but not day 4, then the events of day 4 wouldn’t actually be “making” anything. That would contradict Ex 20:11, which says God made all of it within those six days, not before.  Therefore, the plain reading is as follows: - Light was created on Day 1 (but not the sun). - Sun, moon, and stars were made on Day 4. - All of this happened within the six days of creation, as Ex 20:11 affirms.  Again, if you say the sun already existed before day 4, then you must say it was made before the six-day creation period, which contradicts Ex 20:11.",2025-05-31T14:47:57,0,1,0

Victoria Police said they were called to a home in Endeavour Hills early on Sunday morning where they found 21-year-old Giew Ter Tuol dead inside a home with knife wounds. Distraught family members turned up at the scene later than morning, and a woman was seen wailing “they killed my son” before collapsing and being taken away by paramedics.  A 19-year-old man from Springvale South was arrested nearby and is still being interviewed by homicide detectives.  That man also suffered stab wounds to his hand, arm and torso, and was knocking on doors asking for help and saying he was worried about the safety of his family, Nine News reported. The pair had arrived at the home after being questioned and released by police over another matter.  The stabbing death came a day after another African man, 36, was stabbed to death at a public housing complex in Ascot Vale on Saturday morning, and on Monday a 29-year-old man was charged with murder and common law assault.  The two deaths in two days come after another three African males were allegedly killed in Melbourne in the first three months of the year. Last month Sudanese man Timothy Leek, 24, was allegedly hacked to death by a group of other African men with machetes in Lyndhurst in an alleged gang-related attack. In February Congolese man Nathan Mwanza, 23, was allegedly stabbed to death at a bus stop in Wyndham Vale.  And in January Sudanese man Lino Atem, 24, was allegedly stabbed to death just 500 metres from where Mwanza was killed. Header image: Left, Giew Ter Tuol.

This was the plea from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton on Wednesday as he warned corporate elites not to lecture Australians about how to celebrate their country. His message was simple, Australians should come together with friends and family, enjoying a drink, a steak and “celebrate what we have”.  The comments come after one of the country's largest hospitality companies announced it would no longer host Australia Day festivities to avoid causing “hurt”. While Mr Dutton acknowledged Australia was not a “perfect country” he made it clear there was still a lot to celebrate.  We live in the best country in the world, and we should celebrate it,' he told reporters in Sydney.  “What we should do is gather together on days of national significance… and we should make sure that we're united.”  In response to the growing boycotting of Australia Day, spruiked by anti-colonial activists and corporate elites, Mr Dutton said it wasn’t up to others to decide how Australians celebrate.  “(Australians) want to catch up with their mates, unwind, watch a bit of sport on TV. They don't want to be told what the company believes,” he said.  PLEASE READ & WATCH 👇🏼🇦🇺👇🏼🇦🇺 $URL[0]",2024-12-04T13:26:07,60,11,13

twitter/1778949462477480065,"A Japanese official has issued an urgent warning to citizens around the world, declaring that the Covid pandemic was a giant hoax by the global elite designed to push “depopulation drugs” on humanity.  Top Japanese professor Masayasu Inoue, MD, PhD, issued the warning in a video messageposted to social media.  According to Inoue, there was no pandemic at all, it was all a giant hoax orchestrated by the WEF, UN, and WHO.   Leo’s Newsletter reports: The professor accuses these entities of an “extreme violation of human rights.”  The doctor argues that the global vaccination agenda was a fraudulent use of “experimental gene therapy” that was pushed onto “healthy people.”  The United States militarized the premature manufacture and distribution of the vaccines through Operation Warp Speed, which the doctor described as a “fraudulent” pretext based on the supposed urgency of a pandemic. This sense of public panic, urgency and outright hysteria was needed in order to get a new class of genetic vaccines into people’s bodies before proper testing could be carried out.   The bodies of those who received the injections were trained to manufacture a toxic spike protein that collects in bodily tissue and is now causing all sorts of health problems, many of them deadly or debilitating.  The vaccines have been particularly devastating to children and young adults. He warns that the result of rolling out Covid mRNA vaccines has led to “the induction of the terrible drug-induced injury that has never [been] seen in human history.” He said new mRNA vaccine factories are now being constructed in his home country of Japan.",2024-04-13T08:52:57,13708,390,6572

twitter/1846340899543945543,RT @Ferryman999999: 【新闻点评】 为甚么今年的诺贝尔经济学奖竟然被中国海外“民主人士”们抵制？ （陳大民/2024-10-14/USA）         热烈祝贺达龙·阿西莫格鲁等三位学者荣获2024年诺贝尔经济学奖! 并且祝贺今年诺贝尔奖的所有获奖者！       据报道，今年的诺贝尔经济学奖的学者们，十年前以来，虽然还没有获奖之前，但是一直受到中共的攻击。而现在获得诺贝尔奖了，竟然又被中国海外“民主人士”一致抵制。所以，我特评论几句。       10月14日，2024年度诺贝尔经济学奖揭晓，三位任职于美国高校（麻省理工和芝加哥大学）的经济学教授获此殊荣，他们是阿西莫格鲁（Daron Acemoglu）约翰逊（Simon Johnson ）和罗宾逊（James A. Robinson）。        评奖委员会在新闻稿中指出，三位学者研究了体制或者制度是如何形成并影响经济繁荣的，证明了社会制度对一个国家繁荣的重要性。'获奖者的研究有助于我们理解其中的成因：法治薄弱、制度化剥削民众的社会为什么无法带来经济增长或改善？'        这让人想起另外一位诺贝尔经济学奖（1998年）获得者：阿玛蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen）。他最著名的制度论证是饥荒与民主的关系：人类饥荒史的一个重要事实是，没有一次大饥荒发生在有民主政府和出版自由的国家。       我非常认同以上几位学者的观点！我的大学专业背景是管理心理学，我也曾经阐述过经济学奖相同的观点。我认为，国家制度，不仅是一种政治价值观，而且，从管理学的角度看，制度即管理方法。       于是，我们人类就会面临着国家制度的选择和创新问题: 什么样的制度才是有效管理？什么样的制度可能是无效管理？等问题。       当今社会，几乎都是以民主国家为主，从过去的十几个民主国家，不到一百年时间就发展到今天的160多个民主国家了。他们为何选择了民主制度？因为更加有用嘛！       民主制度作为一种管理制度，优越性在于制度设计的人性化，符合人类的心理发展特点，从而调动人的内在潜力和创造力，并带动了经济和科技的发展，同时，这种制度能够大大降低了社会成本，提高国家管理的综合效益。        四十年前，当中国社会主义经济走到绝境的时候，中共为了再度获得统治资源，开始实施“改革开放”的一系列国家战略欺骗计划，也就是一定程度上的民主化改革，并且取得很大的国家经济发展的进步，但是，今天中共又以一种国家战略欺骗的手法，重返社会主义原教旨，导致中国的政治和经济再度陷入死局。这就是本次诺贝尔经济奖项，在国家经济学领域的伟大贡献所在。        那么，根据近来的中国新闻焦点，未来中国的经济怎么走？世界各国的经济专家们广泛关注，以及纷纷发表意见和建议。不过，几乎都是不敢说真话，我认为，根本没有多大意义。 下面，我举例说明。      例子1。近日中文圈经济专家们，炒作的“中共三万亿救经济”新闻焦点太假！真的太假了!       这些所谓的中国专家们，美国之音/自由亚洲电台/轮媒体系/所谓的“反共”大V们等等，大力协调性的炒作中共3万亿印钞票计划，不过，他们炒作舆情主要指向“救经济必败”的焦点，看起来好像在反共，其实，真相不是这样的!             因为中共发布的所谓三万亿救经济计划，只是一个骗局而已，中共高层哪来要“救经济”这种真正意图？他们把那位“两百斤”推上台的真正意图，就是为了“毁改革救专制”“毁中国救中共”嘛。根据分析，近来中国地方政府与中央政府的财政支配权力问题矛盾很大，全国各地政府纷纷倒逼中央。       所以，中共又印了三万亿货币，根本不是为了救经济，而是为了救急维稳的需要，要给各地公务员“出粮”发工资，所谓的救经济只是一个幌子而已，根本没有要救经济这回事！大家明白了没有？        例子2。在2021年时，我曾经举办了《中国民主转型理论和实务高级研讨班》，该班共十个专题，其中之一是经济专题，我第一次论述了'经济红利'概念内涵，并提出当前中国的“人口红利”已经耗尽，推行中国民主转型，只有“制度红利”才是未来中国经济发展的唯一突破口。       但是，我举办的《中国民主转型理论和实务高级研讨班》，竟然没有一位中国海外所谓“民主人士”“反共人士”“经济学者”参与，仅仅有一些中国大陆的网友参加而已，实在是非常不可思议！       例子3。中国海外的这帮所谓的“民主人士”，所谓的专家学者，他们历来都是“只反贪官不反制度”，或者“只反习不反共”“反习护共，灭习保共，习亡共不亡”等策略。他们基本上是配合中共的对外议程，他们不跟自由世界的议程配合，也不跟真正追求中国民主事业的人一起合作。       他们有的人已经来美国几十年了，但是，从来没有介绍过美国民主制度的优点，他们要么仇恨民主党，要么仇恨共和党，并把中国民主失败归因于美国。       因此，各位朋友们有兴趣学习本次诺贝尔经济学奖项理论成的话，请也关注我关于中国民主转型与国家经济政策的论述观点。我早已在@X上公开分享了。       本次诺贝尔经济学奖，其实就是讲制度到底有没有红利问题，这理论给我增加了不少学术信心。       个人观点，感谢大家！,2024-10-16T08:02:28,0,0,2

twitter/1887531392722215069,1978年，日本为纪念中日邦交正常化而拍摄了一部《西游记》电视剧。这部剧在1980年代初引进中国，但只播出了三集就被停播了。停播的主要原因有以下几点： 1.内容与原著相差甚远：日本版《西游记》的内容与吴承恩的原著有很大出入，这引起了中国观众的不满。 2.剧情争议：该剧的一些情节被认为是”狗血”和”口味太重”，不符合中国观众的审美和价值观。 3.角色塑造不当：最引人注目的争议之一是由女演员扮演唐僧。夏目雅子饰演的唐三藏虽然美丽动人，但这种性别颠覆的做法在当时的中国引起了强烈反响。 4.文化差异：日本版《西游记》更多考虑的是娱乐性，这与中国观众对经典名著的期待有所不同。 5.观众抗议：许多中国观众认为这部剧”糟蹋了中国古典名著”，并对此表示强烈抗议。 这次事件引发了不小的轰动，也激发了中国观众对本土制作《西游记》的强烈期待。正是在这样的背景下，中央电视台决定自己拍摄《西游记》，并将这一重任交给了导演杨洁。这最终促成了1986年版《西游记》的诞生，该版本后来成为了中国观众心中的经典之作。,2025-02-06T23:58:47,1,2,0

With @timloughton @DrSasa22222 @benedictrogers @HodgsonFiona @MPIainDS @scullyp  Key points- The international community and the British government must not repeat past mistakes on Burma, where they were supporting the fake reform process by the Burmese military, lifting sanctions and allowing them to buy jets and weapons that they now use to kill our people. The British government needs to take the lead on international action again, like it did after the 2021 coup. We need regular and targeted sanctions that will cut off Burmese military's money, arms and equipment. We need increased and more flexible aid, including in different ethnic areas, through local groups and civil society organisations who do amazing work but often can't access funding.",2025-06-05T20:02:42,61,0,21

twitter/1745292389030478168,2024预测，纯粹猜想，有诸多偏见，不能做投资建议，仅当娱乐，不必当真。  1.L2依然会是2024年最重要的叙事之一。随着dencun升级的到来，L2费用大幅度下降会带来L2生态的爆发。在L2上除了游戏、perp、defi、nft，还有social、depin等也会迎来爆发期。  2.arb、op、zksync、starknet以及blast等L2在全方面与其他公链展开竞争，且随着EIP-4844的落地，以及DA层的演化，在费用和速度上与高性能公链并驾齐驱，arbitrum和solana的生态竞争会是2024年的一大重要看点。  3.zksync在2024年会推出经济机制，成为推动L2爆发的一支重要力量。  4.starknet如果实现突破，会从全链游戏叙事开启。  5. 2024年有一个L2项目稀释后总市值突破1000亿美元；乐观情况下，周期高峰时期会有一个L2稀释后总市值突破3000亿美元。L2市场最终格局在2024年还无法确定，不过这个周期之后会基本定局。  6.btc生态经过铭文一役已经打开了魔盒，有很多团队在进行扩展方面的探索，其中包括索引的去中心化、铭文体系进化、去中心化跨链、zk证明、L2等诸多探索等，一旦取得进展，一是自身生态会发展；二是跟以太坊生态融合也会加速。btc生态的探索是这一周期最引人注目的演化之一。  7.以太坊L1逐渐演化成为B2B链，普通用户的绝大多数交互会发生在L2/L3以及少数高性能L1上，以太坊逐渐成为加密领域的底层资产。同时，随着模块化区块链的演化，以太坊会成为最重要的结算层，多数执行层和部分DA层会外包出去，但最终来说，由于最底层安全的需求，ETH依然会捕获整体生态增长的价值。  8.跟2023年的预测相同，模块化在2024年依然会是重要叙事，尤其会在DA层进行激烈竞争。以太坊再质押领域也会进入DA层进行角逐。在模块化领域，cosmos生态和以太坊生态有竞争也有融合。第三方DA和原生DA之间之间会有竞争，在danksharding没有实现之前，L2急迫的市场需求导致第三方DA存在一定规模的需求。  9.除以太坊和BTC生态之外，cosmos和solana生态也会持续发展，这跟去年年初的预测保持一致。cosmos会通过模块化取得进展；solana则通过一些应用取得进展。此外，随着模块化区块链的成熟，solana其中的一个演化方向是跟其他L2一样，参与到更广阔的加密生态中，跟以太坊的融合度会更高，从而捕获更大价值。  10.web3游戏在L2/L3（arb、starknet等）实现突破，有一款游戏用户超过百万（2023年没有实现，2024应该到了成熟的时机）。基于Arb的游戏链会成为web3游戏突破的前沿阵地。magic在2024随着游戏链+更多游戏的互操作性推出，对web3游戏演化产生重要启示。  11.blur除了融合nft dex、nft借贷、blast之外，预计今年进入nft perp，甚至是L2、btc以及sol生态的nft市场，blur在2024依然有机会扮演最重要的行业搅局者之一。  12.以太坊生态除了L2上项目爆发，预计还会产生较大规模的通缩，从而实现价值捕获。跟其他L1链增发+费用归矿工做安全费用不同，全部新增和费用反馈给质押及持有用户，这会激励更多用户进行质押/再质押，从而进一步锁定流通中的eth。  13.defi中的perp在2024会得到大规模发展，snx、gmx、gns、dydx等都会产生至少5倍于2023年的交易量；perp在牛市不一定是重要叙事，但大概率是基本面最好赛道之一。  14.模块化区块链和跨链技术的推进，会导致以太坊生态与btc生态、Solana生态的融合，这一周期会涌现很多目前还不怎么知名的项目。按照目前btc生态演化，其中有一条路径可能是以太坊承载btc的二层，如果成真，比特币和以太坊的融合度会逐步提升。不管如何，btc的扩展需要走自己的原生道路，类似于atomicals这样的协议，如果能把avm做出来，对btc生态发展会产生重要影响。  15.depin在solana和arbitrum上取得一些突破，这一赛道依然处于建设早期，更多探索类项目会出来。  16. AI依然距离实际落地有较长的距离，但不影响它成为2024年重要叙事之一，基于L2和高性能公链的AI协议也会逐步出现。  17.以太坊再抵押赛道在今年某个时候会成为重要叙事之一。  18.NFT、MEME以及铭文在某个时候复苏，同时带来NFT DEX交易量的上涨，并为NFT Perp推出提供市场基础。  19.部分名人进入nft、meme、铭文领域。  20.随着L2的发展和高频应用的探索，智能合约钱包有机会在2024年开始崭露头角。,2024-01-11T11:51:46,2213,640,1088

He emphasized that pro-democracy activists must never fall into the trap of labeling themselves as “old.”  “It is not age that makes one old, but the loss of spirit and conviction.”  Wang criticized the years spent repeatedly debating whether June 4th still holds meaning or whether street protests are still justified, calling such debates “historical garbage time.”  “We must stop dwelling in self-doubt over the past and instead face the present with clarity and direction.”  He stressed that the nature of the Chinese Communist Party has never changed:  “Whether it is rational resistance, peaceful petitions, moral appeals, or institutional negotiation, the CCP sees all of it as existential threats — as monsters to be crushed with tanks and bullets. Only by annihilating dissent can the regime sleep peacefully.”  “This is not a misjudgment. This is not an exaggeration. It is a cold truth forged through bitter experience.”  Wang issued a clear warning to the democracy movement:  “Only by fully recognizing the CCP’s totalitarian and evil nature can we remain focused and avoid detours.” “Stop fantasizing about persuading or reforming the",2025-06-05T12:07:40,23,2,5
twitter/1934412219103502532,今天我来介绍一下哈维尔的“法律异化”思想。  哈维尔一生都在对抗一种荒诞：当法律不再是自由的保障，而沦为压迫的工具时，所谓的“法治”就成了权力最虚伪的表演。在他看来，极权体制最擅长的不是无法无天，而是将不义合法化——通过精心设计的条款，把暴力包装成“秩序”，把镇压解释为“执法”。    这种“法律的异化”最可怕之处，在于它扭曲了人们对正义的认知。当迫害被写进法典，当异议成为“违法”，受害者甚至开始怀疑自己是否真的有权利反抗。法律本应是保护弱者的盾牌，却变成了强者手中的鞭子；司法程序本应追求真相，却沦为权力自我正当化的修辞术。    哈维尔提醒我们：真正的法律必须根植于道德，而非权力的需要。当条文与人性相悖时，盲从便是共谋。一个健康的社会，不在于它的法律体系多么“完备”，而在于它是否始终警惕——不让法治堕落为暴力的语法，不让正义成为权力游戏的牺牲品。,2025-06-16T08:46:27,15,5,6

twitter/1747516286328873464,"I'm glad someone is cause this is a story that would sink Trump if anyone was paying attention. Long story so I will encapsulate. Vivek got involved in a bad way but is a coward now that he has endorsed the idiot. To make long story short, this all started way back when in 2016 when Trump promised Rastetter head of Agriculture. Senate said nope and away he went but always stayed close with trump. spotted at MAL a few times. Lo and behold, comes out publicly to caucus for Trump in Iowa this past sat AM and that's when all hell broke loose. North IA farmers became vocal, Vivek was told to shut his mouth, then Sat afternoon, Trump was literally ending the Vivek campaign. You can imagine the phone calls as the real reason was the carbon capture pipeline planned for north IA, not the stupid tshirts. And the company who will build and head it is owned by guess who, Brad Restetter. Now enters the other idiot, Burgum, who's State will provide the entry point for this whole project. This has actually been in the works for over 6 years but the hiccup was Senate not accepting Trump push of Rastetter. If Trump enters WH it will be a direct appointment. There are so many farmers who will lose their land as it is confiscated for this project. Farms who have been in their families for generations. When Vivek went up there to campaign with them, they were freaking out and he became vocal. If he had kept his mouth shut, and leaked it to media as someone with a brain would have done, this story would be headlines today. He didn't. I got involved over the weekend to some extent and passed on what I could. Who I passed this onto is on it and I will not comment further on this. And that is the end of my involvement. Total expenditure for this project is in the billions. Not millions. Billions. And Trump's dirty little hands are all over this. I figure his kickback from Summit Carbon will be pretty handsome. $URL[0]",2024-01-17T15:08:44,81,19,44

Apparently Bobby Jr is the one Kennedy that isn’t partially lemming and following the crazies off the cliff! JFK and RFK would NEVER do the things these crazies have done and want to continue!     Democrats have mistreated Bobby Jr, denied him SS and disallowed him to be on the ticket. They weaponized government against both candidates and citizens. They are likely responsible for President Trump’s assassination attempt.     Of all people to NOT support Bobby Jr, I am appalled and shocked that it would be his family members throwing him overboard!     I believed they cared about Americans and America.

twitter/1808181558777418102,"Below are the cost of a Tesla grid battery. Tesla does not publish the cost often so this is an interesting time slot to look up the cost before they take it off again. Also note, I scaled the theoretical order to the max the Website allows.  In my thread from Dec 2022 below, I explained one challenge for the German Energiewende as legislated today: Dunkelflauten - prolonged periods with little wind or sunlight.   To keep the grid safe, Germany will likely need 14TWh of chemical storage by 2035 to survive a Dunkelflaute. But 30TWh are more realistic.   What would such storage cost today, were Tesla able to produce it ever (it couldn’t today)?   3.854 GWh (3,854 MWh) cost US$ 1 billion today, before maintenance & installation. Germany will need 14,000 GWh (14 TWh) or 3,633 of the below grid packs…!  Cost before maintenance and installation: US$ 3.64 trillion. Does everybody understand such cost? The German GDP is USD 4.4 trillion in 2023.   But can Germany not just import French nuclear power to close some of the Dunkelflaute gap? Sure, if France permits and has enough excess capacity. And what will be that price under Le Pen?   And then why did the German government turn off their 20 GW nuclear power plants in the first place if that is the Energiewende plan? If the plan is that neighboring countries bail Germany out? It had the safest nukes globally running until 2022..!  The German Energiewende is to Germany what Biden is to the democratic party right now: everybody knows it can not work but one keeps going anyway. After all, the Green party cannot admit such fundamental mistakes and survive.   But don’t blame them. It’s the people that voted for their ideology and incompetence that are to blame.   The problem now: all ordinary citizens will pay the invoice for incompetence and mass hysteria in Germany and Europe as Germany will push up the price everywhere at the margin over time and until this most dangerous insanity is abandoned.  #Nuclear",2024-07-03T00:50:52,324,35,91

twitter/1890360932272115840,"In the video, you can clearly hear the assailant saying 'I'm going to fucking kill you.' He then went inside, retrieved a knife, and then attacked you, causing a wound.   Even though he aborted the attack, in my opinion, it's still attempted murder, because the actus reus was 'more than merely preparatory.'   It is not necessary for severe injuries to have been caused, or for any physical contact or assault to have taken place at all, as long as it can be proven that the individual had the intention to kill you, which from his own statement implied he did.  Attempted murder has a higher burden of proof than s18 wounding, so it'll be interesting to see how the CPS charge him.",2025-02-14T19:22:22,702,12,34

twitter/1782658607902867927,"So it's taken me some time, but I've finally managed to go through all the references to the Old Testament used in Matthew's gospel as prophecies of particular claims about Yeshua/Jesus. Now maybe I'm missing something but it really does feel like most of these prophecies have been taken out of context. And where they aren't, they don't really describe Yeshua as a Messiah in the Jewish understanding. I'm not prepared to say that the events of the gospels did not happen, I'm just not sure we can really rely on any connection to Judaism to back them up. All we know is that Yeshua was a Jew who taught about the Jewish law and prophecy and G-d's Kingdom and probably performed some miracles and that's about it. I know I'm probably going to get some pushback for this and I'll probably lose followers. But if anyone can give me any sources - whether the Old Testament or anything else - that actually point to the divinity of Yeshua and isn't taken out of context, that would be appreciated.",2024-04-23T14:31:46,3,8,0

twitter/1854897554867036549,"This is long but my brother, a former Army Ranger under Ronald Reagan, wrote it and asked me to share it.    I am so proud of America! As such, I am very disheartened that networks like CNN and MSNBC immediately went to this Trump victory was based on racism and anti-woman sympathies.   America has spoken and it had nothing to do with a woman, racism or whatever other crazy excuses. Although Harris was a very weak candidate, whoever the Democrats put in there would have lost because of the   POLICIES and the makeup that party has become which is no longer the democrat party you are thinking of from 25 years ago. They are now led by anti-American globalists, marxists, socialists, George Soros and people that have no connection with growing up in America that believe America is the bad actor in the world, not the beacon of light and opportunity that it is. An example like Obama and Harris grew up mostly in other countries.   Here is why the Democrats lost:  Total promotion that America is a racist country.   Total destruction of our immigration laws and allowing millions of un-vetted people to walk into our country.   The constant lie that Americans are anti immigrant, instead of the understanding that America is against ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.   Refusal to clean the voter roles and wanting no voter ID and wanting illegal immigrants to vote.   George Soros backed DAs across the country not upholding our laws who are anti-police.   Horrible foreign policy run by people with no experience, exuding weakness across the globe.   The horrible Afghanistan withdrawal   DEI and critical race theory policies taking over America, placing unqualified people in positions based on skin color and race. This was also evident in the cabinet and administration positions.   The embracing of the neutering of the strong American male including in the military.   Forcing children to have transgender surgeries without parents’ approval or knowledge.   Men in woman’s sports.   Wokeism   Democrats love of and compromised by China.   Ridiculous economic and tax policies that caused inflation and high interest rates.   Total reversal of American energy policy based on crazy climate change policy. This is what caused the high food costs and high everything, NOT price gouging as they led you to believe.   The cancel culture and using the department of justice as a weapon, not based on the laws.   The understanding that the Democrat party is the actual dictator and authoritarian ruler.   The democrat party allowing anti-Jewish members to bloviate while staying silent.   Pumping pornography and anti-American sympathies into the classrooms of young children.   This should be enough reasons although there are others as well.   If the main stream media was not so compliant with the Democrats and biased, the victory would have been much larger in my opinion.  The Republicans won because Donald Trump is a strong leader who brought America first and common sense policies to the American people and was committed enough to withstand every attack against him and his supporters!",2024-11-08T22:43:34,32,4,12

twitter/1950251603300073689,没有崩溃，何来重建？  批判《后中共时代》军事干预设想的战略幻想起点  评《OSS in China Again: The Role of US Special Operations Forces after CCP Collapse》  2025年，哈德逊研究所（Hudson Institute）发布了一份由余茂春主持，名为《后共产党中国：为后中共时代做准备》（China After Communism: Preparing for a Post-CCP China）的研究报告合集，集结了多位研究者对“后共产党时代”中国局势的设想与分析。该合集的开篇文章，题为《OSS in China Again: The Role of US Special Operations Forces after CCP Collapse》，作者署名为“匿名（Anonymous）”，试图构建一种战略设想：在中国共产党政权突然垮台之后，美国应以外交与军事手段迅速介入，在中国境内推进秩序重建与国家重构，尤其强调美军特种作战部队（SOF）在其中的角色。  文章设想，美国将在中共垮台后的中国部署政治顾问与特种部队，在北京、沈阳、成都等地协助解放军稳定边境、执行人道援助、管理核武器，甚至协助建立临时国家媒体“中国之音”，参与制定宪法、重建制度等工作。这套构想复杂详尽、术语密集，表面上是冷静的战略推演，实则是一场精密包装的政治幻想剧本。  而整套叙述中最致命的逻辑空洞正是它的起点：它完全跳过了中共政权如何垮台、为何垮台、谁使其垮台的讨论，直接预设了一个稳定而顺从的“后中共中国”已然存在。这一前提未曾论证，却构成了整个方案的基础。于是，所有军事安排、政治干预、心理战再部署，都浮在一个未被说明的真空之上。没有崩溃，何来重建？这不是战略文本，而是思维惰性下的剧场演出。  一、跳过“政权崩溃机制”，整篇设想建立在逻辑悬空之中  《OSS in China Again》将中共政权的“崩溃”视为已然发生的背景，而非需要证明的前提。文章完全避谈以下问题： 中共是如何垮台的？是内部政变、民众暴动、战争失败，还是制度崩坏？  军队会服从谁？公安、国安系统会如何转向？ 地方政府是否还能运转？社会秩序会否崩溃？ 民间是否具备自组织能力？有无足够的社会资本完成治理接替？  一切都被省略。文章直接跳转到“临时国务院已成立”“军队服从新体制”“美国可以部署人员入境”等状态，完全绕开转型过程中最痛苦、最关键的环节。这不是对未来的假设，而是对现实的逃避。一个战略文件若不解释政权更替的机制，其后续安排便无任何实际意义。  二、重演失败的历史，制造合法性的幻觉  文章大量引用二战后OSS（美国战略情报局）在中国东北地区的短暂行动，试图构建今天美军特种部队介入中国的“历史原型”。它甚至声称，美军将“重返沈阳”，完成“1945年未竟的任务”。然而，历史事实与这种叙述大相径庭。  当年OSS在东北的实际任务仅限于解救战俘，且迅速被苏联红军驱逐。战后马歇尔调停失败后，美国在满洲的外交尝试全面受阻。无论是情报机构还是使领人员，在当时的政治现实中都处于边缘乃至被排斥的状态。以这段失败经验来证明今天美军可以顺利进入中国协助建国，是一种历史记忆的重构，是将失败美化为潜在正当性的政治修辞手法。  三、误判中国社会心理：民族主义不会随着中共的垮台而消散  文章假设，中国人在失去中共政权后会自动欢迎美国军事力量和外交资源进入——不仅接受，还配合。这是对中国社会心理的严重误判。  我本人不认同民族主义，但我必须指出：无论“前共产党”或“后共产党”时代，民族主义早已深深植入中国社会结构与集体心理中。它既不是中共专属，也不是靠宣传就能植入的东西；更不会因为政体的变更而自然瓦解。  将民族主义简单视为“封闭”、“非理性”、“必须清除”之物，不仅是错误判断，更是思维懒惰。这类设想预设民族主义会自动退场，而新的政治秩序能在“外援+舆论”的协助下平稳建立，这是典型的冷战时代剧本化思维，完全忽视当代中国社会的复杂张力与认同动力。  四、将信息管控外包给“新政权”：对自由媒体的理解依然权力化  文章提出建立“中国之音”，由临时政府控制、发布消息、疏导情绪，还建议由前中共政治理论家王沪宁出任“解释者”，帮助中国社会“转型”。这一构想的核心假设依然是：舆论需要管控，信息需要设计，“转型”需要导向—只是由旧机制的技术人员换了个立场服务新政权。  这并非自由媒体生态的想象，而是权力宣传逻辑的延续。文章并未反思，为什么中国社会无法形成真正的言论市场与公共讨论，而是继续通过媒体工程、话语引导、心理战部署等方式实现“思想重构”。它并非真正愿意交还民众话语权，而是希望用新的内容装进旧的控制机制。  五、未更新的文化母体：从《河殇》到“后中共剧本”的思想遗绪  尽管这篇文章署名为“匿名”（Anonymous），但其整套叙述结构——从“陆地对抗海洋”的文明二元对立，到“通过外力实现现代性转化”的政治救赎叙事，再到“民族主义是一种应当去除的落后情绪”——都清晰地映射出上世纪八十年代晚期纪录片《河殇》的文化母体。我判断，这篇报告极有可能出自苏晓康，或与其思想圈层密切相关之手。  问题不仅在于这类叙事的重复，更在于它的思维惰性与时代脱节。《河殇》式的批判语言，曾在当年针对封闭意识形态起到一定启蒙作用，但它所构建的“西方=文明 / 中国=病态”的简化结构，早已无法承载今日世界的复杂与流动。苏晓康式的创作逻辑，早已从当年的“先锋姿态”退化为今日的“陈腐模板”——它将文化批评等同于文明判决，将转型方案简化为舆论主导和外力输入。  文章中最典型的表现，是其对中国民族主义的轻视与误判。我本人并不认同民族主义，但我必须指出：无论“前共产党”或“后共产党”时代，民族主义早已成为中国社会结构与集体心理的一部分。它既不是中共专属，也不是靠意识形态灌输就能植入的东西；更不会因为某个政体的消亡而自动瓦解。将民族主义简单视为“封闭”、“排外”或“非理性”，只暴露出作者对中国社会结构的粗疏认知与视觉狭隘。  换句话说，这篇报告的问题不是战略错误，而是思想过时；不是技术误算，而是文化逻辑僵化。它本质上是在用一套三十多年前的观念模板，为今天的中国编写一部理想化的崩溃剧本。它不愿面对现实中真正的制度惯性、社会心理张力、合法性真空、碎片化治理，而宁愿借助一套熟悉的叙事——“共产党倒了 → 军队服从新政 → 民族主义消退 → 外力协助重建”——来维系自己的逻辑完整。  而这正是《河殇》之后许多中国知识分子在思想层面未曾完成的工作：对自身叙事框架的更新与修正。  正如《河殇》当年所渲染的波澜壮阔：“蓝色的海水只要灌进黄河，中国就会翻天覆地。”这正是这篇「匿名」作者的报告所继承的幻想母题——一旦“中共崩溃”，外部秩序与理性将如洪水般灌入，带来“重生的中国”。但时代早已改变：现实的黄河，已不是抽象的象征物，而是一张复杂社会结构的沉重底图；现实的海水，不再携带唯一的现代性密码，也不再具备自证正义的力量。幻想可以复活语言，但无法构建秩序。  结语：这不是战略，是剧本  《OSS in China Again》不是一份基于现实可能性的政策文件甚至连策略层面都达不到，仅仅是一份叙事性剧本。它回避因果逻辑、误读历史经验、误判社会心理，却试图用密集术语与细致行动安排，为一个不存在的“后中共世界”提供脚本指导。  但中国未来的道路，不是剧本可以预设的。它必然是痛苦的、不确定的、由内生张力推动的。真正的战略思考，应该关注制度演化、社会动力、文化心理与民众主体性，而不是在崩溃尚未发生、路径尚未打开的状态下，预设一场由外力主导的重建神话。  如果不面对中共政权可能“如何垮台”，一切关于“垮台之后”的叙述便注定是空中楼阁。,2025-07-30T01:46:30,11,6,4

twitter/1830974470036824421,"Bacterial Cells Transmit Memories to Offspring, Even Without Genetic Changes    + Research Background: A groundbreaking study from Northwestern University and the University of Texas-Southwestern has revealed that bacterial cells can 'remember' brief, temporary changes to their environment and body, and pass these memories on to their offspring for multiple generations. This finding challenges long-standing assumptions that heritable traits are primarily determined by DNA.    + Research Process: The research team, led by Northwestern's Adilson Motter, used Escherichia coli (E. coli) as their model organism due to its simplicity and well-understood gene regulatory network. By employing a mathematical model, they simulated the temporary deactivation and subsequent reactivation of individual genes within the E. coli cells. The aim was to determine if non-genetic traits could be transmitted through the cell’s regulatory network instead of its DNA.    + Research Findings: The study found that these temporary gene deactivations led to lasting changes in the regulatory network, which were inherited by subsequent generations of E. coli. This suggests that cells can pass on non-genetic traits through changes in gene regulation. The findings open the door to new medical applications, such as combating antibiotic resistance by making bacteria more susceptible to treatments across generations.    + Source: The study, titled 'Irreversibility in Bacterial Regulatory Networks,' was published on August 28 in the journal Science Advances and was supported by the National Science Foundation.   #BacterialMemory #GeneticResearch #NonGeneticInheritance #EcoliStudy #ScienceAdvances",2024-09-03T22:21:46,0,0,0
twitter/1830905730100318608,"Early Galaxies Were Not Too Big for Their Britches After All  + Research Context: Recent observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) initially suggested that some early galaxies in the universe were unexpectedly massive, challenging the standard model of cosmology. These findings sparked debates about whether the fundamental theory that explains the composition and evolution of the universe needed revision. However, a new study led by Katherine Chworowsky, a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, reveals that these galaxies are not as large as they first appeared. Black holes within these galaxies may have caused them to seem much brighter and bigger than they are, helping to resolve the earlier controversy.  + Research Process: The study, published in The Astrophysical Journal, is part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey led by Professor Steven Finkelstein at UT Austin. The team examined data from JWST, focusing on galaxies that appeared unusually massive. They discovered that many of these galaxies likely host black holes rapidly consuming gas, which generates heat and light through friction. This additional brightness made the galaxies seem more massive than they actually are.  + Research Results: When the research team accounted for the light emitted by black holes, the remaining galaxies aligned with predictions from the standard model of cosmology. This finding suggests that the universe's fundamental principles remain sound. However, the study also noted that there are still twice as many massive galaxies in the early universe as expected, possibly because stars formed more efficiently in the denser conditions of the early universe. The study supports the notion that while some mysteries remain, the standard model is not broken.  + Source: For more information, the study can be accessed in The Astrophysical Journal.
