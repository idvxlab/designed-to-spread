twitter/1906052861122723980,"To add to this and to explain why this era's 'economic commanding heights ' manufacturing is different - it's software enabled. For example an EV,  smartphone, drone and obviously a robot, rely on software. But if you make the software free, as BYD has with its self drive software, then you can sell more hardware.  This means that you have added network effects to hardware (Nvidia does this with CUDA, Apple do this to phones with IOS - but they don't own the whole manufacturing).  The issue for the US (and Europe) is that China does own all the hardware manufacturing for its network effect enabled hardware and it owns the supply chain too, and with a population of 1.4 billion,  it has stronger network effects than the US. There have been two eras of digital era distribution: PC era and smartphone era, but there have been three eras of internet business model: 1. Online only (social networks), 2. Online meets the real world (Uber, Airbnb etc.) 3. Online meets hardware and manufacturing.  The third era is exacerbated by the fact that AI has production rather than distribution network effects (software is cheaper to build not just cheaper to acquire users) so it can be used for manufactured goods which have smarts embedded. Europe fell behind with software so companies like German car manufacturers can't compete with EVs. Meanwhile the US not only has less network effects than China, it has less control of supply chains (e.g. batteries and components) so still relies on China for manufacturing or components so Tesla can't compete with BYD. China wins this third era of digitisation where it meets all physical goods.",2025-03-30T02:36:29,240,15,23

twitter/1746922538217750969,"Canada must clarify position on South Africa’s ICJ case against Israel  On Friday, @JustinTrudeau was asked about Canada's position on South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the ICJ, and replied that 'our wholehearted support of the ICJ and its processes does not mean that we support the premise of the case brought forward by South Africa.” This was widely interpreted by journalists and observers as an outright dismissal of the case. A statement issued later by @melaniejoly included similar language. CJPME condemned Canada for rejecting the premise of South Africa's case, especially without providing any rationale to justify doing so.  CBC journalist @EvanDyerCBC, however, citing Global Affairs Canada, is now claiming that Canada’s statements have been misinterpreted, and that Canada’s intent was to express neutrality regarding the merits of the case. If this is true, then it is imperative for Canada to clarify the matter and state its position in plain language.  CJPME was not the only observer to interpret Trudeau’s statement as an outright dismissal of the premise of South Africa’s case. This is how it was widely reported in the media, with headlines explaining that Canada “does not support” South Africa’s case, or that Canada 'rejects' genocide allegations. Israel’s Consul General in Toronto tweeted that “Canada is siding with Israel.” And even a member of Trudeau’s cabinet, @YaaraSaks, wrote that “as the Prime Minister said, we do not support the premise of the question raised by South Africa.”  To those listening, Canada's statements were not neutral. If the intention was neutrality, Canada could have clearly stated that it does not take a position on the merits of the case and that it will respect the decision of the court. Canada’s statements did not provide any straightforward language like this. Canadians should not have to read between the lines to decode the position of their government, especially on a matter as serious as charges of genocide.",2024-01-15T23:49:24,566,90,271

As a combat veteran and commander in some of our most storied units such as the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and 10th Mountain Division, I raised my right hand, accepted the challenge and served this country, her people, and the Constitution. After military retirement, I wanted to continue to serve by making a difference in education, so I entered the fray in Washington, DC public schools in 2009 serving alongside Michelle Rhee and the fantastic team she built. Within two years, Wake County Public Schools (Raleigh/Research Triangle area of NC) hired me as superintendent where in under two years we had the best two academic years in the history of that school system under that testing regime, especially for low-income students. I dedicated myself to lifting the most unfortunate in our society. As Secretary of Transportation of NC, I worked tirelessly to connect small towns to big cities and increase opportunities for citizen education, employment, and recreation opportunities through a series of measures to decrease travel time and congestion, increase safety and jobs, and incentivize multi-modal transpiration such as ship to rail to highway. After leaving government service, I started a business and created jobs until I was called back by @realDonaldTrump to serve in 2020. Mr. Boot would rather talk about a few out of character comments on then-Twitter than my decades of service to this nation and her people. Boot has never reached out to me to have a conversation; my guess is primarily because he knows I’m a good leader with a good heart who has only the best interests of this nation in mind. He would rather defame and impugn my character and integrity as a cudgel against President Trump than provide a full assessment of the contributions and sacrifices I, and so many others, have made for this country. If asked to serve again, I would, as before, do so honorably and endeavor to make a positive difference in the lives of all Americans, as has been my record. Indeed, what exactly have you ever done for this country, Mr. Boot? @GenFlynn",2024-11-02T03:14:55,99,16,42

Willie Brown is 30 years older than Harris and was very married at the time. It was public. It was an embarrassment.  Do most women sleep their way up? No. Do many? No. Do some? Probably a few. And those few do horrific harm to the image and reputations of all the 99-plus percent of women who earned everything they have achieved in their lives.  That is why Kamala Harris, who openly and brazenly slept her way into California Democrat state politics by publicly hooking onto the very married Willie Brown, should matter to all women — regardless of ethnicity, color, religion, or party. Just as, despite the wrong assumptions on which she plays, Harris simply is not an “African American” — her parents are from India and British Jamaica — she likewise is not a woman who rose the way that Americans teach their daughters to achieve. Yes, she went to high school, college, and law school. Good for her. So did zillions of other Americans. And then, with law degree in hand, those other Americans had to prepare résumés, do often-unpaid internships and summer volunteer jobs if not clerkships, interview for entry-level positions, and do the lowest-on-the-totem-pole legal tasks at their new positions for a few years as they worked their way up. It was not as simple as just being a mattress.  Kamala Harris’s story denigrates women who worked hard all their lives, faced cruel gender stereotypes, heard and ignored snickers, encountered and overcame real true misogyny, and yet ultimately achieved great accomplishments. Kamala Harris instead is a poster child for those extremely few women who despicably chose to take the short-cut up the ladder through frisky behavior with married men 30 years their senior. That play and strategy did not work out well for Monica Lewinsky, whose name forever will be associated with vice. Our society’s rejection and mockery of Lewinsky to this day, a quarter century later, is the vice precedent that should define Kamala Harris. Vice precedent, Kamala Harris.'

I'm in Cairo with families who risked their lives, paid all their savings to escape the devastation, their only hope is the visas they were granted. They paid tickets to Aus only to be told at the airport their visas were cancelled. The reason given is disingenuous dishonest and callous: that Aus doesn't think they intend for their visit to be temporary. Did you honestly think for one minute that all these families were rushing to apply for visas in the middle of a genocide because they wanted to be tourists in Australia? It was YOUR government that told us to apply using visa subclass 600, it was YOUR government that gave us all this false hope. We are devastated beyond imagining.

twitter/1901797121440833789,"President Trump has declared that former President Biden's controversial pardons of J6 committee members are void because they were signed using an autopen.   Two White House officials from the Biden administration suggested to The New York Post that a key Biden aide may have exceeded their authority by unilaterally determining what to sign.  The question we have at Lindell TV is: Who was that staffer?  Trump posted: 'The pardons that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because they were done by autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime.”  When asked if Biden’s autopen orders and pardons are void, Trump replied: 'I am sure that Biden did not have any idea that it was taking place and somebody was using an autopen to sign off pardons- as an example, just one example- the J6 Unselect Committee...think of it...they gave pardons with an autopen. I don't think Biden knew anything about it.'  Trump also mocked Biden by posting an image replacing Biden’s presidential photo with a portrait of an autopen.   In his prior post, President Trump added: “Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.”  Today, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked by CNN whether the president’s legal advisers spoke to him before he posted his claim on social media.   'The president was begging the question that I think a lot of journalists in this room should be asking,' Leavitt said.   When pressed for evidence by the CNN reporter, she replied: ‘You're a reporter, you should find out.’'  Leavitt’s comments raise bigger questions: Was Biden aware of what was signed in his name? If not, who was actually running the show? And what are the legal and political consequences? We will keep you updated as we investigate.   @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RealLindellTV @RudyGiuliani @EmeraldRobinson @alisonintheknow @DiamondandSilk @PressSec @MariaRyanNH @KristiLeighTV @ALEXNEWMAN_JOU @gatewaypundit @elonmusk @TheJusticeDept @julie_kelly2 @Liz_Cheney    @PamBondi @dbongino @FBIDDBongino @FBIDirectorKash @Kash_Patel @NobleOne",2025-03-18T08:45:42,1336,83,388

The stress, job insecurity and fear of dismissal become a mental illness which turns into PTSD.  Many employees choose to become bullies themselves in order to survive.  The most psychopathic ones, i.e. your manager, are usually natural-born bully pros.  It is these psychopaths today who call the shots in our politics and corporations, refusing to acknowledge the bullying of people and nature which has brought this planet to the polycrisis of overshoot” #economics #anthropology #psychology",2024-10-10T15:11:34,247,5,90

twitter/1896595103910686943,"Does Zelenskyy was peace?  GROK answered my question: Yes, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that he wants peace for Ukraine. However, his vision for peace is specific: it must be 'just and lasting,' not a temporary truce that leaves Ukraine vulnerable to further aggression from Russia. As of March 3, 2025, he has emphasized that peace requires strong security guarantees—such as NATO membership or firm commitments from allies—to ensure Russia cannot attack again. For instance, in recent statements, like at a London summit on March 2, 2025, he said, 'For peace to be real, real security guarantees are needed,' showing his focus on ending the war sustainably rather than accepting a fragile ceasefire.  His actions, like pushing for Western military support and advocating for Ukraine’s 'Victory Plan,' suggest he believes peace is achievable only from a position of strength, not through concessions that compromise Ukraine’s sovereignty or safety. While some critics interpret his rejection of weaker ceasefire proposals as a desire to prolong the war, his public rhetoric consistently frames peace as the ultimate goal—just on terms that protect Ukraine long-term. So, yes, he wants peace, but not at any cost.",2025-03-04T00:14:44,108,26,52

twitter/1783510794623123824,"🔍🪖🇺🇦FOCUS sur le 2S22 Bohdana à l'occasion de la diffusion de photographies montrant sa présence dans une cinquième brigade : la 43e brigade mécanisée.   🚛Le 2S22 Bohdana est un canon de 155 mm autotracté sur châssis à roues développé à partir de 2016 qui peut tirer 5 à 6 coups/minute à 40 km. Un prototype est produit en 2018 à partir d'un camion KrAZ-63221 6x6 et présenté à la parade de la fête de l'indépendance le 24 août de la même année. Mais en raison d'un retard de développement, de problèmes bureaucratiques et d'une bataille juridique entre l'entreprise et le Ministère de la défense, sa phase d'essai n'est toujours pas achevée au début de l'année 2022, si bien que le prototype est le seul exemplaire existant lorsque la guerre éclate. L'entreprise qui l'a développé ayant le bombardement des Russes, le projet semblait même enterré.  🚛Mais le succès du prototype, intégré à la 55e brigade d'artillerie, dans sa participation au côté des CAESAR à la reprise de contrôle de l'Île aux Serpents, relance le projet avec un financement de l'Etat ukrainien au printemps 2022. Mais étant donné que l'entreprise PJSC AvtoKrAZ basée à Kramatorsk, qui produisait le KrAZ-63221, a fait faillite en 2021, il a fallu trouver un autre châssis. C'est le MAZ-6317 6x6 qui a été choisi et modifié. Une solution de courte durée puisqu'il s'agit d'un camion biélorusse, si bien que lorsque la production en série débute en janvier 2023, les Ukrainiens ne peuvent utiliser que le stock de MAZ-6317 qui était en leur possession avant la guerre et une fois épuisé il a fallu trouver encore un autre châssis. Cette fois-ci l'armée ukrainienne a opté pour le Tatra T815-7 8x8, un camion tchèque qui avait été acheté avant la guerre par Kiev pour moderniser sa flotte de lance-roquettes multiples BM-27 Uragan  devant passer au standard Burevy. Sauf que faute de munition cette transformation n'a pas eu lieu rendant disponible les camions. Mais là aussi le nombre reste limité. Si bien que début 2024, on voit apparaître un quatrième châssis : le Tatra 158 Phoenix 8x8.  🚛Parallèlement à l'enchaînement des camions support, la capacité de production augmente. En décembre 2023 une déclaration de l'armée et une autre de Zelensky affirmaient qu'au moins 30 avaient déjà été construits et que 6 le seraient désormais chaque mois. En avril 2024, Zelensky annonce qu'en mai les Ukrainiens seront prêts à en produire 10/mois. Vous pourrez observer ces photographies 👇 présentant une usine secrète de Ukrarmor où on peut voir trois châssis de 2S22 dont les cabines sont produites au côté de IMV Novator, l'assemblage du canon se faisant dans un autre endroit. Cette augmentation de la production explique que l'on peut observer le 2S22 Bohdana dans un nombre croissant de brigades : => 1re  brigade de la Garde nationale (BGN) 'Ivan Bohun' :  le prototype d'abord intégré dans la 55e brigade d'artillerie semble avoir été transféré au cours de l'année 2022 dans cette brigade. => 57e brigade mécanisée (BM) : c'est en juillet 2023 que l'on aperçoit pour la première fois au sein de cette unité ce canon automoteur sur la base du MAZ-6317 6x6. => 10e brigade de montagne (BMont) en janvier 2024 avec la version 3 (Tatra T815-7 8x8). => 47e brigade d'artillerie en février 2024. Il s'agit cette fois-ci de la 4e version du canon automoteur avec le châssis Tatra 158 Phœnix. D'ailleurs en mars ces mêmes 2S22 sont présentés avec un blindage cage, preuve de la menace grandissante des munitions rodeuses et des drones. => 43e brigade mécanisée (BM) en avril 2024 avec la version 3 (Tatra T815-7 8x8).  🚛A ce jour sur la 50 aines d'exemplaires produits par les Ukrainiens, une seule perte a été visuellement confirmée en février 2024 souvent confondu avec un CAESAR 8x8 danois. L'engin a été endommagé sans savoir s'il est réparable. L'artillerie automotrice est donc un secteur de l'armement où les Ukrainiens peuvent non seulement remplacer leurs pertes mais aussi exercer une montée en puissance. D'ici la fin de l'année 2024, les 2S22 Bohdana et les CAESAR devraient constituer une branche essentielle de l'artillerie ukrainienne.",2024-04-25T22:58:04,248,10,34

twitter/1826603299875029477,"RT @Zlatti_71: The Kursk invasion by Ukraine also highlights the resilience of the Russian leadership in the face of Western propaganda.   Many expected that Russia would do everything in its power to push Ukraine out of the Kursk region. This expectation was exactly what Ukraine had hoped for—the diversion of Russian forces from the Donbass front to relieve pressure there by pulling them into the Kursk region.   However, this has not happened. Instead, Russia continues to wage its war of attrition against Ukraine, now in the Kursk region, while maintaining dominance in the Donbass. The Russian forces, which Ukraine had anticipated would withdraw and create gaps for their own advantage, have remained in place.   Thus, the attempt to force Russia into a reactive position has failed.   Despite all the criticism, including on platforms like X, the Russian government seems entirely indifferent to how Western media perceives or judges it.  In conclusion, Russia's ability to resist external pressures and adhere to its strategic goals underscores a certain degree of strategic independence and resilience that complicates the situation for Ukraine and its allies.",2024-08-22T20:52:17,0,0,990

Free Chinese AI systems may very well break the ability of vested interests in the west to “manufacture consent”. And across every imaginable policy area from foreign policy to economic policy.  Put another way, anyone in the west will be able to reliably filter all western media and political discourse through free Chinese AI systems which may likely reliably highlight and explain away anything approximating BS or propaganda.  In a very real sense, it may likely become incredibly challenging for vested interests in the west to “spin” the public at large because of free Chinese AI systems like deepseek.   The future of course is uncertain, but I think this is a certainly a medium term possibility.   If it comes to pass, the current era of vast upward redistribution of wealth in the west, along with slowing innovation, will likely come to an abrupt halt.

This could have sparked civil unrest, as it was clear who was truly in control. When the 2  assassination attempts on President Trump failed, they reportedly enlisted billionaires like Miriam Adelson and Bill Ackman to align with him, offering substantial financial support to secure his silence. However, President Trump skillfully navigated their strategy, and now it’s time to expose them and halt the nation’s decline.

twitter/1715479948859978138,RT @whyyoutouzhele: 一位网友分享的翻墙经验，也欢迎更多人在评论区补充。  自高中起，我已有十余年的翻墙经验，在这里简单聊聊心得，有一些是从编程随想博客学习的。  一 翻墙之前的准备 1 硬件 在2023年的今天，大多数国产安卓手机都内置反诈中心，或者带有可以监控手机的服务，如果你使用国产安卓手机翻墙的话，被发现的概率非常大，甚至无法安装翻墙工具。解决方案：购买iPhone、购买Google Pixel。  如果使用Windows系统的PC翻墙，请务必保证系统内没有国产安全软件（例如360、金山毒霸等）、没有腾讯微信和腾讯QQ。事实上，你应该尽量不使用国产软件。  如果你是上访者、社会活动家，或者政治敏感人士，建议使用带有Tensor处理器的Google Pixel手机（据传目前相关部门无法破解取证这类手机，消息未证实），或者全新安装自己的Windows PC，且手机与PC均不安装任何国产应用。  如果你使用iPhone且有被审查手机的风险，可使用Xlocker或者AAlocker隐藏相关APP。  如果你已润出墙，请放弃使用国内购买的手机。  2 软件 若使用Windows系统的PC，请使用Firefox ESR（编程随想推荐）或者Chrome浏览器。如果你无法获取这两个浏览器，可临时使用Edge。  若使用国行iPhone，且使用Safari浏览器，请在“设置-Safari浏览器-欺骗性网站警告“处关闭该选项。  若使用国行安卓系统，为安全考虑，不建议翻墙。  3 联系方式：邮箱和手机号 无论注册机场还是VPN，都不应该使用国产电子邮箱，更不能提供手机号。请使用Protonmail，此处不展开介绍，可自行搜索。若你无法翻墙注册Protonmail或Gmail，可临时注册Outlook，注册时不要使用真实姓名和手机号。  可以购买Ultramobile的Paygo手机卡，月租3美元，由此可注册Google Voice，这样就有了一个实体卡号 、一个虚拟卡号。实体卡和Google Voice均可用于注册Twitter（现X）、Telegram（据传将与腾讯合作，故已不推荐）等平台。  二 翻墙途径 目前大约有三种：自建服务器、购买机场服务、购买VPN。我并不会自建服务器，所以只讨论后两者。  1 购买机场服务（又称梯子） 三原则：使用非常用非国产邮箱、月付而非年付、遵守客户守则。  当你注册一个机场后，先观察能否试用，若不能试用，可以先购买最便宜的套餐月付。随后使用该机场服务，尝试访问品葱和大纪元，若无法访问，说明该机场有嫌疑与相关部门合作。建议及时删除账户更换机场，直至这个测试通过。  若可以使用加密货币付款，更建议使用之。  机场可能随时跑路，请同时购买两家机场服务。若一家跑路，可使用另一家。  若机场提供QQ交流群，则嫌疑加重  若可以正常使用其服务，请遵守相关规则，例如防止泄露节点信息、不要使用P2P服务等。  2 购买VPN 在你能用机场服务的前提下，又有Paypal或者其他支付方式，就可以购买VPN了。  三 假如你无法翻墙，如何开始 第一步：使用PC，打开国内的必应；  第二步：搜索擦边关键词可以搜索到部分机场，且不翻墙可访问；  第三步：观察机场网站能否提供Clash for Windows之类的工具。若提供，则可在不翻墙的情况下，下载翻墙工具。然后试用或购买服务，便可初步翻墙，打破”不翻墙就无法获得翻墙工具”的困境。  第四步：挂代理打开Duckduckgo或Google，开始寻找一家安全的机场，或者购买VPN，就此进入自由的网络世界。  ——这只是提供一种思路，办法还有很多。例如找一个翻墙的朋友帮你，或者使用赛风、Lantern这种不安全的翻墙方式临时翻墙，等等。  四 翻墙之后 为了自身安全，请学习社会工程学和信息安全相关知识，可以看编程随想的博客。学习使用TOR。在这里简单说几个tips：  1 海外平台账户不要和国内平台账户的网名相同，最好每个平台使用随机产生的不同的网名。防止撞库。  2 请使用不同的密码。应该有自己的密码算法，此处不展开介绍。  3 若频繁发布言论，请改变自己的语言习惯。例如你在国内习惯说“今儿个吃了么？“，则可以改为 ”今天吃饭了吗 ？”，如此便不会被有心之人认出来。如果嫌麻烦，把自己的语言翻译成英文，再Google翻译成中文，发布翻译后的结果，就不再带有你的语言习惯（此条即编程随想提到的“行文风格“）。  4 若需发表的内容里含有自己的声音，请使用AI配音或者变声器，防止声纹识别。  5 若需发布图片，请清除EXIF信息。  6 请不要分享、点击有安全嫌疑的链接  7 付费会暴露自己的个人信息。在你使用支付宝或微信支付购买机场服务时，就已经不够安全。  8 简体中文互联网世界充斥着大量诈骗信息和假信息。请努力学习英语，突破信息茧房。  9 如果你也是反贼，在墙内请隐藏自己的倾向，保护自己。伪装成粉红，在朋友圈转发一些正能量。  10 如果你使用iPhone，记得关闭某些APP的iCloud同步。  11 编程随想在2010年就提到了输入法问题。亦要及时清理浏览记录和Cookies等。,2023-10-21T05:27:46,0,0,2753

This transparency is essential for building public confidence in the judiciary and the legal system as a whole.  Court proceedings are more easily accessible in the United States compared to Canada.

twitter/1864392480973590556,"The Burisma/Biden corruption is but a microcosm of the global intelligence/manipulation strategy that is employed by the Corruption Industrial Apparatus (which we refer to by its acronym). Everyone plays the game and dances the dance between mutually assured destruction and mutual benefit; domestic politicians and our agencies like the State Department and its dark counterpart gain power and influence by partnering with similarly corrupt foreign politicians and operatives.  In this sense, the Burisma storyline was not “the” operation in Ukraine, but neither was it just “an” operation in Ukraine. Similarly, the Biden family corruption is neither “extreme” nor is it “typical”; it is just the game itself.    This has been reflected in our own domestic information operations by the uncanny fear of Trump, who is/was an outsider and had not played the game in the same sense as our captured politicians and other Beltway bureaucrats and media apparatchiks, as well as the galling attempts to carry water for the Bidens and shut down any opposition or exposure of their misdeeds, by hook or by crook.  For any true exposure of the Biden family’s corruption could serve to expose the corruption of the entire rotting globalistic power struggle among the various elites and intel agencies.     But Joe/Hunter are our own modern day version of Icarus, flying too close to the sun, and thus providing a glimpse to the “normies” of how actual foreign policy and backroom deals are formed, and subsequently how far those in power will go to suppress such information.  There are now cracks in the dam, but the fight expose the monstrosity is not over.  There is an opportunity, thanks to the defense of free and open speech by @elonmusk and with the potential reforms by @realDonaldTrump in his second term, that we can shine more light on the machine and thereby hasten its destruction, but it is by no means a given.  We are but an “Army of Davids” facing the largest conglomeration of power structures the world has ever known, and they will not go out without utilizing every weapon in their arsenal, with the purpose of crushing not just this period of upheaval to their international order, but ensuring that they can never be resisted again.",2024-12-05T03:33:00,131,14,50

At the bat of an eye, TikTok is swarming millions of users with a disinformation campaign to fight a bill in Congress. TikTok falsely claims that 'Congress is planning a total ban of TikTok' and directs users to call their representatives.  This is a bald lie. In reality, the bill would force TikTok in America to separate from its communist party-connected parent company in China called ByteDance.  The US government does not have the authority to shut down TikTok at a whim. We have this thing called due process of law.  But right now, teenagers are frantically calling Congressional offices and literally threatening to commit suicide if TikTok is shut down. It's that bad.  This is only a taste of what's to come. Think about all the propaganda and chaos that the Chinese Communist Party will unleash through TikTok if China invades Taiwan (as it has said it will do) and draws the United States into war.  Millions of people rely solely on TikTok for their daily news. The flood of wartime disinformation will be overwhelming. A huge sweep of America will struggle to separate truth from lies.

Peki Kimdir bu Kahraman gelin kısaca anlatayım:  ❗️Osman Batur (1899–1951), Doğu Türkistan’daki Altay bölgesinde doğmuş Kazak kökenli bir Türk liderdir. Çin zulmüne karşı halkını ve toprağını korumak için savaşan bir bağımsızlık mücahidi ve Türk halk kahramanıdır. ❗️1930’lu yıllarda Çin yönetimi, Altay’daki Türk köylülerinin silahlarını toplamak ve yeraltı zenginliklerini (özellikle madenleri) yabancı şirketlere açmak isteyince halk büyük tepki gösterdi.  ❗️Bu sırada Osman Batur, silahını teslim etmeyi reddederek, “Bugün silah veren, yarın canını verir” diyerek dağa çıktı. Direnişi burada başladı. ❗️1941’de Çin’in ve Rusya’nın desteklediği baskıcı yönetime karşı Altay bölgesinde büyük bir milli ayaklanmayı örgütledi. ❗️1943’te 'Erikti Altay Teşkilâtı' adlı bir direniş konseyi kuruldu. Bu teşkilatın kararıyla Osman Batur’a “Han” ve “Batur (Kahraman)” unvanları verildi. ❗️Moğolistan ve Sovyetler Birliği’nden kısa süreli destek aldı. 1944’te Doğu Türkistan Cumhuriyeti kurulunca ilk tanıyanlardan biri oldu. ❗️Direnişi sadece Altay bölgesinde değil, İli ve Kulca gibi Doğu Türkistan'ın başka bölgelerinde de halkı cesaretlendirdi. ❗️Komünist Çin 1949'da Doğu Türkistan'ı tamamen işgal edince Osman Batur tekrar dağa çekildi. Ancak sayıca üstün Çin ordusuna karşı koymak zordu.  1951’de esir düştü, işkence gördü, halkın gözü önünde aşağılandı ve 29 Nisan 1951’de kurşuna dizilerek idam edildi. ✅Toprağını ve halkını savundu. ✅Çin emperyalizmine karşı ilk sistemli Türk direnişlerinden birini başlattı. ✅Doğu Türkistan tarihinde “millî kahraman” olarak anıldı. ✅Hayatı boyunca özgürlük için savaştı, tutsak yaşamadı. ✅ Türk gibi savaştı Türk gibi öldü.",2025-04-30T04:03:13,164,3,29

I don’t hate gay people, or any other species.  Gay pride parades are a bit too much for me.    I thought the way the transgender topic was rolled out was very strategic and odd. The left’s immediate reaction showed me it was presented as a trap. If any negative comment was made the reply was identical from all news outlets; “Bigot, homophobe, racist…”  I grew up Catholic and like all faiths I was taught gay and transgender were wrong.

In official paperwork, @Georgia_AG has stated he will NOT investigate anything on behalf of the State Election Board (SEB), specifically the 2020 election in Fulton County.   It appears @ChrisCarr_Ga is complicit in the fraud in one of the most corrupt counties in the country, Fulton County.   It is important to note @GovKemp defunded the SEB with a line item veto. Meaning the SEB now has no money to hire their own attorney and do their own investigation.   Right now, the SEB is at the mercy of the SOS Brad Raffensperger’s legal council and we have seen how well that is working out. @GaSecofState and staff are part of the problem too.   Even if the SEB were to get the funds another way, the SEB would not have subpoena power to investigate election fraud claims in Fulton County, of which they have overwhelming evidence.

twitter/1930398944246263831,"Szanowny Panie,  dziękujemy za głos pełen troski i zaangażowania. Z polskiej perspektywy trudno jednak nie poczuć zażenowania, gdy niemiecki polityk publicznie komentuje wyniki demokratycznych wyborów w Polsce — zanim nowo wybrany prezydent zdąży w ogóle objąć urząd, nie mówiąc o jakimkolwiek działaniu. Polska demokracja nie potrzebuje nadzoru ani protektorów.  Z coraz większym niepokojem dostrzegamy, że owa „wspólnota wartości”, na którą tak chętnie powołuje się Unia Europejska, bywa stosowana wybiórczo. Głos państw Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej wciąż zbyt rzadko spotyka się z równym szacunkiem i zrozumieniem. Nie odrzucamy Europy — domagamy się w niej podmiotowego miejsca. Suwerenność i równość nie są sprzeczne z integracją, lecz są jej fundamentem.  Europa to nie tylko wspólny budżet i rozporządzenia płynące z Brukseli. To przede wszystkim przestrzeń wzajemnego szacunku, pamięci i zobowiązań. Historia, do której Pan dyskretnie się odwołuje, uczy nas, że nawet najlepsze intencje mogą przerodzić się w dominację, jeśli nie towarzyszy im pokora wobec doświadczeń innych narodów.  I skoro już mówimy o praworządności — nie sposób pominąć faktu, że Polska, mimo upływu blisko 80 lat, wciąż nie doczekała się ani reparacji, ani elementarnego finansowego zadośćuczynienia. Zanim więc zażąda Pan od naszego kraju kolejnych zobowiązań, proszę uczynić prosty, lecz symboliczny gest: proszę spróbować odzyskać i zwrócić choć jedno z tysięcy polskich dzieł sztuki, które do dziś zdobią ściany niemieckich muzeów.

twitter/1862928782837092773,"It is time for an honest discussion about Turkey’s role in destabilizing the Middle East.  Erdogan’s foreign policy began as a bold, rebellious, neo-Ottoman vision—an ambitious attempt to restore Turkey’s influence over former Ottoman territories. However, this vision was eventually co-opted to serve Western interests in the region. What proved intolerable to the West, however, was Erdogan’s growing hostility toward Israel, exemplified by incidents like the Mavi Marmara crisis.  The turning point came in 2016. On a fateful night, Erdogan found himself on the brink of elimination during the coup attempt. Forced to plead with his people over FaceTime—appearing like a character pulled from a bad parody—he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by commandos at his resort in Marmaris. That night, the old Erdogan died.  The message from the West was clear: opposition to Israel’s agenda was unacceptable. Erdogan capitulated almost immediately. Since then, his resistance has been reduced to little more than hollow rhetoric. His behavior over the past 13 months underscores this transformation. Despite fiery speeches, Turkey continued to supply oil to Israel without interruption, and Erdogan has worked to undermine Assad—one of Israel’s staunchest adversaries in the region.  Critics are right to point out that the United States and Israel benefit most from these developments. Yet, their success would have been far harder to achieve without Turkey’s willing participation. Turkey has become a hub for militant state-sponsored Islamism, with its influence stretching from Syria through Central Asia to China’s Xinjiang region.  It is Turkey that targets so-called “Turkish brother nations” with a toxic blend of radical Islamism, revisionist history, pan-Turkism, and victimhood propaganda. This strategy not only extends Turkey’s influence but also radicalizes individuals, turning them into tools for Western geopolitical objectives. The infamous Crocus terrorist attack in Moscow, for instance, was traced back to Turkish training camps.  Meanwhile, the jihadis left festering in Idlib have been unleashed once more, spreading chaos across Syria as they did a decade ago. This chaos is not incidental—it is cultivated, supported, and funded by the Turkish state. Under Erdogan, Turkey has become the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, a willing accomplice in advancing the U.S. Empire’s objectives in the region.  The rest of Erdogan’s posturing is mere theater—smoke and mirrors designed to deceive only those still willing to believe in a dream that has long since died.  From Moscow to Beijing, it’s time to face this reality.",2024-12-01T02:36:48,14510,1221,4206

twitter/1927413939995824172,"I've mostly been only retweeting recently, and for a rather simple reason: I'm rendered virtually speechless by what Israel is doing to Gaza and the world's unabashed complicity.  I knew that our leaders are corrupt and there are a lot of angry, bitter people in the world who externalize their misery onto innocent third parties.   But I did not predict that a country--Israel--could get away with burning children alive, indiscriminately bombing a civilian population, decimating entire families, targeting journalists, medical workers and their families for execution, shooting children in the head, starving 2 million people, corralling them into concentration camps with the promise of food--all live-streamed for the world to see, for 19 months.  And at most we get feeble protest from a few Western leaders about Israel going too far and mumblings about possibly maybe reconsidering support. And that's not to mention the vicious jubilations from a shocking number of Americans and Israelis.    It has become clear to me that evil is much more prevalent than I ever could have imagined before, and that many or most people can readily be convinced to support the most heinous of atrocities, or to ignore them.  The capacity of modern technology to simultaneously inflict degrees of suffering impossible centuries ago, and to broadcast that suffering to the world, makes evident that for all of our apparent advancement, we have not evolved morally as a species from the earliest days of human existence.",2025-05-28T01:17:47,709,88,193

They can rarely use it because it needs milk and butter which is hard to get from regular food banks. 2. Boxed milk is a treasure, as kids need it for cereal which they also get a lot of. 3. Everyone donates pasta sauce and spaghetti noodles. 4. They cannot eat all the awesome canned veggies and soup unless you put a can opener in too or buy pop tops. 5. Oil is a luxury but needed for Rice a-Roni which they also get a lot of. 6. Spices or salt and pepper would be a real Christmas gift. 7. Tea bags and coffee make them feel like you care. 8. Sugar and flour are treats. 9. They fawn over fresh produce donated by farmers and grocery stores. 10. Seeds are cool in Spring and Summer because growing can be easy for some. 11. They rarely get fresh meat. 12. Tuna and crackers make a good lunch. 13. Hamburger Helper goes nowhere without ground beef. 14. They get lots of peanut butter and jelly but usually not sandwich bread. 15. Butter or margarine is nice too. 16. Eggs are a real commodity. 17. Cake mix and frosting makes it possible to make a child’s birthday cake. 18. Dishwashing detergent is very expensive and is always appreciated. 19. Feminine hygiene products are a luxury and women will cry over that. 20. Everyone loves Stove Top Stuffing.

twitter/1754227416237568484,"I think I've decoded the underlying message in the 'Trump aszasination' narrative deployment...   As much as MAGA doesn't want to consider the possibility, it still remains a possibility...    But not a probability...       I think the PRIMARY reason for this narrative deployment is to force EVERYONE to consider what would and should be done in Trump's abasence...    WHY YOU ASK?  So we realize once and for all that not ONE MAN (person) can do this alone... it has never been about 'Trump'... it has been about the Republic...    It was to get us to learn that collectively 'we the people' hold the real power...     The power of uniting behind one another to not allow a tyranny to be established in our nation... now or ever again...    That United we are strong, and divided we are weak... That's what I'm getting from it...",2024-02-05T03:36:22,63,21,20
twitter/1927109708327911481,"The trap was the constitution and Trump sprung it in broad daylight... [they’ve] been after him since day one... from the moment he descended that golden escalator, the Deep State system activated...   Not just political enemies... the entire intelligence community, federal law enforcement, state prosecutors, activist judges, and [their] media handlers... [they] tried to stop him with scandal, smear, indictment, impeachments, gag orders, raids...     But [they] missed one critical detail... Trump wasn’t defending himself... he was baiting the system...       Every move they made, every case they filed, every lie [they] told... it all became part of the record... he let [them] walk into the trap... and the trap was the Constitution... it started at the local level...     They weaponized rogue DAs like Alvin Bragg, who revived a dead misdemeanor case to fabricate a felony...        Letitia James ran a civil case so twisted she claimed Trump inflated property values... even though banks were paid, profits were made, and no one complained...         Fani Willis indicted Trump for asking a question about election integrity... a question backed by mountains of sworn affidavits, video evidence, and constitutional authority... Every time a judge allowed it, every time a motion was denied, every time a gag order was issued... [they] marked themselves, on paper, for history... Then came the federal tier... Trump’s Executive Orders during his first term were surgical... he wasn’t just undoing Obama’s damage... he was laying constitutional landmines... EO 13765 rolled back Obamacare's mandate enforcement... activist judges rushed to block it, exposing their disregard for legislative process... EO 13818, the sleeper, targeted global human rights violators and allowed for seizure of assets connected to corruption and trafficking... it laid the foundation to financially gut cartel connected officials, even inside the US... EO 13848, triggered by foreign interference in elections, created the legal framework to seize foreign-owned media, tech platforms, and corporate assets... it has never been revoked.... it remains active... EO 13959 blocked American investment in Chinese military companies... hitting the real financial pipeline of globalist control... BlackRock, Statestreet, and Vanguard tried to dance around it... too late... the paper trail is sealed... and every time one of these orders was challenged in court, the ruling told you exactly who the judge served... the Republic, or the Deep State regime... Then came 2025, and Trump didn’t come back to play games... this time, the gloves were off, and the Executive Orders were missiles... An EO reactivating Continuity of Government put military and civil authorities back on constitutional footing... that’s why the Pentagon’s silence is so loud... [they] know the chain of command is no longer fake...   A new EO launched the American Sovereign Wealth Fund, signaling the end of foreign control over U.S. assets... no more BlackRock (etc.) gatekeeping... no more IMF leeching... the era of public theft is ending...     Another EO banned all DEI programs in federal agencies and public education, a direct hit on the ideological occupation... lower courts tried to block it... that forced the question straight to the Supreme Court... will [they] stand with the 14th Amendment, or stand with Marxist indoctrination?      Then came the real test... an EO restoring constitutional law in public funding and education, cutting off all federal dollars to any entity violating 1A, 2A, 10A, or due process... no more censoring parents, no more woke boards hiding behind federal grants... simply put, if you don’t serve the Constitution, you don’t get paid... Every one of these orders was a trigger...   Each challenge, a mirror...     Each ruling, a confession...       And now, SCOTUS is being forced to choose, in full view of the American people... [they] can no longer hide behind “precedent'... [they] either honor the Constitution as written, or [they] expose themselves as compromised...     This isn’t random... this is game theory executed with surgical discipline... Trump read the Founders blueprint... he used the Federalist Papers as legal casing... Federalist 78 - The judiciary has “neither force nor will, but merely judgment'... Federalist 81 - Warned against judicial tyranny and unchecked interpretation... Federalist 45 - The federal government’s powers are “few and defined.” The rest belong to the states and the people... He followed the map, and used it to collapse the machine from within... now the whole thing is unraveling... The DOJ is exposed, Merrick Garland sat on child trafficking cases while chasing concerned parents at school board meetings... The FBI is exposed, fabricating FISA warrants to spy on a sitting president, then rigging social media algorithms to bury truth... hiding Hunter laptop... The CIA is exposed, architecting regime-change operations at home, just like they did abroad... The courts are exposed... operating as ideological weapons, not judicial bodies... and now, the Supreme Court is standing at the edge...   Rule with the Constitution, or fall with the rest... This was never about Trump being above the law... it was about making the law reveal who is actually beneath it... The Founders built the tools... Trump picked them up... and now the corrupt system... from clerk to chief justice... is standing in the open... Trump didn’t tear it down...   He made it destroy itself...     One EO at a time...       One judge at a time...         One ruling at a time...           This is The Storm...             And the Constitution is the Lightning...

You call him a “Nazi” and he reminds you of the “Nazi hating the Jewish” lol…did you know that his son in law is Jewish? All of this rhetoric about him being “racist,” yet he’s done most for black Americans since Abraham Lincoln. On top of that he’s defended the LGBT community when there was the gay club shooting in Florida whilst he was President, even immediately made a speech about how he will do everything in his power to protect LGBT citizens so they’ll never have to see a day like that again. Then you have Kamala who has been in office now for 3.5 years who has openly said (along with President Biden) that she has been an integral part of all major decisions made while in office, yet she’s all over the media saying so many things need to change and she’s gonna be the change…but then proceeds to there is nothing that she would’ve done differently than Biden. Ridiculous.

I may not have the exact same struggles of those people, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care about it.

Zhu Shunzhong, a well-known media personality, resigned from his position as deputy editor of Beijing Youth Daily to expose this horrific truth, but his reports were quickly suppressed, and the prison even changed its name to cover up the crimes. Although the National Health Commission and the Ministry of Justice of China have both issued instructions to address this, the Inner Mongolian prison authorities still perform fake inspections and continue real co-detention, continuing the murders.

twitter/1864684645599858901,"For the first time, it has been revealed that the Yoon Suk Yeol administration in South Korea confirmed through forensic analysis of the National Election Commission (NEC) servers that there was an election fraud involving 'computer manipulation'.  The controversy over 'computer manipulation' that altered election outcomes, which spread widely following the April 15, 2020 general election, has been confirmed by the state to be not just a suspicion but a reality, marking the first such acknowledgment in the history of constitutional governance.  According to an exclusive investigation by Sky Daily on the 5th, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) discovered records of election fraud through computer manipulation during a joint security inspection of the NEC servers from July to September last year.  Multiple intelligence sources report that the NIS urgently reported these findings to the presidential office at the time.  An intelligence source familiar with the matter told us, 'The NIS confirmed through a 5% forensic analysis of the NEC servers that there was election fraud in the past.'  However, under the Moon Jae-in administration, the NIS's investigative capabilities were significantly reduced, preventing immediate action, and the presidential office did not immediately transfer the case to the prosecution.  An anonymous source stated, 'The NIS's counter-espionage function has become virtually non-existent, so they tried to pass the investigation to the prosecution through a presidential report. However, it seems the presidential office did not immediately hand it over to the prosecution.'  For the prosecution to investigate, they need to obtain a search and seizure warrant from the court. However, there was concern that even if the prosecution requested such a warrant, the court might block it.  Under the current system, Supreme Court justices and judges at various levels hold positions as the chairpersons of the NEC and regional election commissions, and judges are implicated in election fraud suspicions. Numerous lawsuits alleging election fraud have consistently been dismissed by the courts until now.  However, during a state of martial law, search and seizure can be conducted without a court warrant.  Another source told us, '(Kim Gyu-hyun) the Director of the NIS mentioned the confirmed election fraud in a meeting with former intelligence agency heads during his tenure.'  This source corroborated the same facts, stating, 'After receiving a report from an NIS executive about the confirmation of past election manipulation through partial forensic analysis of the NEC servers, Director Kim immediately reported it to the presidential office.'  The NIS announced the results of the joint security inspection on October 10 last year, focusing only on the potential for hacking into the NEC's computer system, omitting this fact.  Meanwhile, there is speculation that President Yoon Suk Yeol's recent declaration of martial law might be related to investigating election fraud.  Previously, President Yoon declared martial law in a national address on the night of the 3rd, and the National Assembly passed a resolution demanding the lifting of martial law in an early morning plenary session on the 4th.  After President Yoon declared martial law, approximately 120 martial law troops and 100 police officers entered the NEC's Gwacheon office at around 00:30 on the 4th. Earlier, around 10 special agents, presumably, entered the NEC just two minutes after the martial law declaration at 22:30 on the 3rd.  It has also been newly discovered that about 50 martial law troops entered the NEC's Gwanak office, and approximately 130 martial law troops and 100 police officers moved into the Election Training Institute in Suwon, Gyeonggi, showing that the NEC was secured before the National Assembly.  Our newspaper initially obtained critical intelligence about the election fraud last summer, and after cross-checking last month, confirmed the information to be true. However, we have delayed the report to align with government steps and after internal discussions.",2024-12-05T22:53:58,266,4,142

twitter/1874209144204652942,新年开篇：感谢《纽约时报》对神韵持续的大力推广  年初岁末，总是比平时要忙碌，所以有时候回复和祝福新年的问候都很潦草。 但是再忙，那些真正需要感谢的人是不能错过的，否则不就是忘恩负义了吗？ 那么年初，最要感谢的人是谁呢？ 呃…，首推《纽约时报》以及那位华裔记者洪芊芊女士。   早上起来，看到纽约时报的一则中文推文，是“揭露”神韵艺术团的，其中有一句话非常逗，当然也是最关键的一句，原文这样说：“神韵通过从李洪志的追随者身上榨取大量志愿劳动，”   我觉得最逗，也最挑逗的就是这个词：“榨取”。   按照“榨取”的原意，按照“榨取”的基本规律，不应该是受害者自己站出来和神韵讨个说法吗？为啥这些被“榨取”的人毫无知觉，让纽约时报这样不辞辛劳的一遍又一遍提醒呢？   在这里我自首一下：我每年不但志愿劳动，而且近几年我还每年资助神韵在当地的演出。我喜欢，我高兴，我愿意，我觉得我花的钱中，那些赞助神韵的钱最有意义，能够帮助这样的演出发扬光大，我觉得非常荣幸，请问这算罪么？  纽约时报在这位华裔记者的努力下，反神韵已经反的神经质了，这位洪女士都有点像祥林嫂了。这位洪女士的几个X贴文全都是关于神韵的。我就是替这位洪女士惋惜：您花了一年多的时间就弄出了这个结果，这不是给您老爸丢人么？ 要知道您父亲年纪轻轻的时候就当选了共党统战部领导下的欧美同学会的海外理事的哦，人家是美国大学的终身教授，而且还兼职浙江大学的客座教授，虽然做为“历史学家”，人家剑走偏锋去研究中美关系，但好歹也被中共重视。您这个成果，好像赚不出自己的工资来喔，难怪纽约时报日子越来越艰难。   洪女士的报道看了半天，我读出了纽约时报对神韵报道的内涵和外延：当前神韵演出，已经今非昔比。在起步的时候，有深厚的支持者，帮助神韵推广，现在不但有深厚的根基，而且更有广泛的观众，所以神韵不但未来更有大放异彩，而且永远都有一群支持者做坚强后盾。   所以这个演出，有根基，有市场，有赞助者，有观众，有内涵，有生命力。更有纽约时报不断的加持，连广告都不需要再做了，所以这一波神韵巡演的风光，离不开纽约时报的奉献和自燃。所以，感谢纽约时报，祝纽约时报2025新年快乐，祝洪女士继续努力，赶超老爸，能早日入选欧美同学会的海外理事的候选名单。那样再报道神韵，相信广告效应更好。   当然在祝福之余，我再弱弱的提个建议：我知道做为记者，最希望自己的报道受关注。那样您不妨采访一下自己的老爸，他是怎么当选欧美同学会的海外理事的，在那个理事名单上，都是大咖云集，倒是洪朝辉的名字默默，从这个角度来说，那后面一定有些励志的故事。如果您把那些励志的故事写一下，在中美关系紧张的今天，这一定是一个大火的话题。说不定又有一个新的中共2025在美国政界的千人计划名单出来呢，今年是2025的第一天，这个话题多应景啊。   最后，感谢您对神韵的一路陪伴，因为神韵在未来的一路风光，离不开您与中共关系上的一路走光。,2025-01-01T05:40:55,98,14,30

But that could change soon.   - The UAE's announcement of a field hospital in Gaza is coordinated with Israel and is likely linked to the forthcoming evacuation of the al-Shifa Hospital. The evacuees could then be transferred to the UAE's field hospital.   - Hamas will try to do everything in its power to stop the evacuation of the al-Shifa Hospital because it knows very well what comes right after the evacuation. This is precisely why the hospital continues to function despite media telling us every other day that the fuel is about to end. It's because Hamas has been providing the hospital just enough fuel to keep it functioning. Simply put, the evacuation of the hospital is not in the interests of Hamas.   - The media must do its job and educate the world about the Hamas HQ under the al-Shifa Hospital.",2023-11-07T04:57:51,2025,0,907

twitter/1740911149258871238,"Is peace a victory for Ukraine?  It's impossible to say that a country that makes peace by giving part of its territory is victorious. And this is true. It's not only about Ukraine, but the Russians are defeating the second European army, supported by 40 countries.   The truth is that the spaced delivery of weapons and the low industrial capacity of allies have weighed in this defeat.  But, in general, the correlation of forces has been disproportional since February. Even in the best scenarios, Ukrainian chances would be minimal.  However, the article from The New York Times is very interesting because it draws attention to other points. The Russians may achieve a military victory, but in part, the plans of some allies are also being achieved. The Russians lost their biggest clients and the most valuable market in the world.   Europe still has problems with energy, but they have decided to avoid dealing with Russia. This is a defeat for the Russians, who are building bridges with other clients, but the damage has been done, and anyone who denies this isn't being honest.  While the large sanctions over Russia may not hold back their military, they are surely a headache for many of their companies. Sanctions can be ineffective in reaching their goals, but life is easier without them. In fact, Russia was hit by the new Western policy, but will leave this war with high morale and stronger ties with the East.   Is this a good long-term strategy for the West, who is vying for hegemony against the East? Personally, I don't think so.   But what is the West going to give to Ukraine? Don't come and tell me that Ukraine wasn't a proxy war. It's a proxy war where the West and Russians played a long game for almost two decades. Of course, many Ukrainians wanted to change their orbit, but the cost was very high.  What can the West give to Ukraine? Reconstruction?   Russia isn't going to allow a militarized Ukraine on its borders, so it's probable that in peace terms, Ukraine needs to limit its army and its military industry.   Will the West provide security guarantees for Ukraine? How? Will the sanctions remain on the negotiation table?  And the last question: Why would Putin have an urgency to negotiate if he is advancing on the entire front?   One thing is certain: the war has been unbalanced for a long time, and Ukraine has an improbable chance of victory.  Some readers will say that Ukraine hasn't been defeated yet or even that Ukraine is winning the war.   Well, all I have to say is that the Ukrainian army has descended into chaos, where everything has become scarce, from manpower to ammunition, personal equipment, vehicles, and, mainly, funds. And I'm one of the few persons who is reporting this since several months with total independence.  The Ukrainian army is now bravely surviving in defensive positions and creating media events to maintain foreign support. The country isn't defeated, but it's progressively happening.  Peace must be negotiated soon to avoid more deaths and destruction. But I don't see clearly what can be negotiated.",2023-12-30T09:42:17,258,61,58

twitter/1895899204134060538,"I have a Theory about the SEC’s unexplained delay in dismissing the @Ripple case.    It might not be the SEC.  It could be that @Ripple is negotiating hard to get the SEC to agree to vacate some or all of Judge Torres’ decision.  The Torres decision was unquestionably GREAT for $XRP holders, BUT  The (a) finding of securities law violations and the (b) injunction (with attendant “bad boy” provisions) are not so great for Ripple.  This is particularly true if Ripple is considering a future exempt securities offering or IPO.  I believe the SEC would have accepted a settlement—where both sides dismiss their appeals and the SEC takes the $125 million penalty—in a heartbeat.    So, it makes sense (to me at least) that Ripple could be negotiating for a better deal than that.    This is all pure speculation on my part. I could be wrong.

IRS Form 1040 poses this question near the top of page one--right under Filing Status:  'At any time during 2024, did you:  (a) receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or  (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset?)'  The question (presumably?) is designed to flag whether the taxpayer is likely to have realized capital gains or earned income from digital assets.  BUT the 1040 Form does NOT have a similar question asking tax filers whether they have engaged in transactions in gold, silver, stock, real estate, cars, antiques, baseball cards or any other asset class--even though those transactions could also trigger capital gains or income tax.  So why the special surveillance treatment of digital asset holders?  Why should the IRS be building a database of names, addresses, social security numbers (and other private information) of all lawful holders of digital asset in the U.S.?    --Asking for 50 million friends.  @DavidSacks",2025-01-16T22:49:04,464,26,111

twitter/1849148855033659734,过去的一个星期，我每天晚上 9 点后开启纯自然流直播卖我在做的瑜伽垫（我搞了个新概念，叫课程垫，瑜伽垫实在卖不过别人），一共卖出了 500 张垫子，有 18 万元的销售额。  这次我好像比之前“更懂”直播卖货了，所以在这里记录分享一下。  今年四月份开了自己的直播号，用 AI 生成了一些引导词，我自己录音配上视频素材，做成了十几个 5 分钟左右的视频发布上去，攒了 1000 个粉丝然后开始尝试直播，也卖卖公司的瑜伽辅助工具，其实我的粉丝涨得很慢，截至目前也不到 6k ，但我认为这 6k 粉丝的画像跟我所做的业务非常匹配。  之前我的直播总是断断续续，我给自己找的理由是随便玩玩，不图这个赚钱，但实际上真正的原因是，连续播两天，第三天再播，我就不知道说什么了，我总是希望每次直播都讲新的内容，一场两小时的直播，我希望讲的东西不重样，实在没话讲了我就哼歌，因为我总是过不了自己心理那一关，讲重复的东西，多少有点不尊重观众的时间，所以有时候一停就是一个多月不播也不发视频。  但是这次，我做了新产品，直播卖货相当于带着任务来播，感觉完全就不一样了，我先是看了数据，人均在线时长也就 3 分钟，另外观察到，有时候我刚讲完一个事情，评论区马上就有人说，能不能再讲一遍。我悟了，原来观众都是流动的啊，还流动得如此快，那我还有啥不好意思讲相同的内容了呢，讲完一遍，再来八遍，只要自己不尴尬，尴尬的就是别人，都开直播卖货了，还要啥脸😂  所以这次连续 7 天直播（破我自己的连续直播记录了），我也没觉得有之前那么累，讲一个故事，卖两轮货，完了再重复一遍又一遍，直到完成当天的销售额就下播，话术都打磨得越来越溜了。  你感兴趣也去试试，每个人都可以直播卖货赚钱。,2024-10-24T02:00:17,517,38,81

twitter/1869580397258125813,这个帖子数字基本都是错的。香港财政非常健康，相对于世界大部分经济体好太多了。 香港回归中国的时候，财政储备（可以认为港府手里可以花的现金）是4570亿港币，然后2002-2003年SARS以及之后几年经济差，持续赤字，2005年降到2960亿，降了35%多。2005之后经济回升，每年都是财政盈余，到2019年财政储备到了1.17万亿港币。相当于主要是2005-2019年这14年，政府攒了很多钱（卖地，增值税等等）。 然后2020年疫情开始，香港受到很大打击，时间之长大大超过了SARS疫情。同时，香港又是居民福利最好的经济体之一，政府在教育医疗等方面的花费依然照旧，还要发钱刺激消费。这样2020-2025年就一共产生出四千多亿的赤字，财政储备下降幅度和SARS之后差不多，但现在一般预计下个财年会恢复成盈余（最新财年的赤字已经很小了）。 讲什么港英移交的时候一万多亿盈余，一年赤字五千亿，五年把多年的积累花完了，都是胡扯。基于这个数字的讨论是戏弄大家吗？😂,2024-12-19T11:07:56,110,9,2

So there is nothing 'shady' going on here, and even if it was disengaged it would still be counted in statistics.   The issue here is that he accelerated to 40 miles per hour himself — he had already driven straight into the wall, barely giving Autopilot any time to react.   He then appears to have manually disengaged by turning the wheel, rather than removing his hands from the wheel and pedals to show that the car was operating of its own accord.

I think it was speaking of Elizabeth Strout that Hilary Mantel said she had a prose style of such lucidity it was a moral virtue in itself, and that’s exactly how I feel about Garner. All three diaries are now available in  the UK in a single volume (they’re actually published here tomorrow, the 13th, by @wnbooks) and in them is revealed, in sometimes agonising detail, the life of a writer, of a woman, of a person so vividly engaged with both the everyday and moral struggle of just being in the world.

De nombreux membres seniors du Parti communiste chinois hésitent à entrer en guerre car ils possèdent des actifs et des membres de leur famille à l'étranger, et ils craignent qu'une guerre ne détruise leurs intérêts acquis. Le public chinois (« Lao Baixing ») est de plus en plus lassé des mensonges et de la propagande du PCC, et des indicateurs tels que la baisse du taux de mariage reflètent à la fois des pressions sociales et économiques ainsi qu’un changement dans l’opinion publique. Si un conflit militaire de grande ampleur devait éclater, il est très probable que le peuple chinois et certains membres au sein du système prennent des mesures, voire renversent le régime actuel. Par ailleurs, le taux de chômage en Chine – en particulier chez les jeunes – est gravement sous-estimé, et les données officielles ne sont pas fiables. Le chiffre réel pourrait atteindre 40 à 50 %. Avec la fuite continue des industries manufacturières, la bulle immobilière et une crise de la dette qui s’aggrave, la situation économique globale est extrêmement sombre. #takedowntheccp #CCP #NewFederalStateofChina #SteveBannon #WarRoom #USDefenseStrategy #WolfWarriorTactics #IndoPacificSecurity #CCPUnrestrictedWarfare #ChinaUSARelations",2025-03-14T12:16:18,12,1,12

Se dovesse scoppiare un conflitto militare su larga scala, è altamente probabile che il popolo cinese e alcuni membri dell’apparato statale agiscano, potenzialmente arrivando persino a rovesciare l’attuale regime.Inoltre, il tasso di disoccupazione in Cina, soprattutto tra i giovani, è gravemente sottostimato, e i dati ufficiali non sono affidabili.

I did a lot more than just talk and write. I didn't see you at campaign HQs at 1:am, or spending 100 plus nights straight on the road, months of 19 hours a day campaign schedules.  Year after year. Winning tough races in blue states. You were a cheerleader. Fine. Politics needs cheerleaders.    But you didn't sit across from candidates when they told you how much they believed character was the most important issue. You didn't help run campaigns about restoring honor and dignity to the White House. You never helped elect candidates who called themselves conservatives.   The supposedly conservative party in America has nominated a criminal who is a sexual predator, a pathological liar, a candidate of Russia. The party that has no room for a Cheney.   So, if it helps you rationalize the collapse of conservatism in America by saying that those of us who actually did the work for the Republican party are not supporting a criminal because we like 'leftists,' fine. Have at it. Write that up.  It's silly but if it makes you feel better, tell yourself that lie.   Some of us actually believed that character counts, that decency was essential in our public life. I know, that was naive when clearly it was just marketing slogans. But some of us helped elect a lot of Republicans and we're proud to use those skills to defeat a sick evil that has consumed our old party.   We're going to win. And if you actually cared about a sane, center-right party in America, you'd be doing everything possible to crush this Republican party.",2024-08-18T08:25:33,5448,618,1143

twitter/1945889140165472293,夕树舞子——每个时代有每个时代的顶级（上篇）（中文字幕）  每年有每年的第一，每个时代有每个时代的顶级。这种情况下，要说“夕樹舞子是全时代的顶级……”也没太多违和感吧？ 即使在容貌水准显著提高的现在，也丝毫不逊色，在当年更加不输给任何偶像， 所有产品全创下“万单位”销售记录。 出道是想克服倍受困扰的“男人恐惧症”， 仅1年就暂时停止工作。 之后凭借知名度出演了影视剧， 同时盗版在某港等地大量上市， 引发了洲级别的人气爆发，被称为“亚洲女神”。  1995年4月从“蒂芙尼厂（非珠宝品牌）”专属出道， 5月成为宇宙厂双专属。 若有人问你谁是第一位双专属， 你可以大大方方的回答，可能是夕樹舞子！ 瞬间进入顶级行列……不用多说， 说一下她的“男人恐惧症”， 据说她住在男友家时，被男友的哥哥非礼， 从此对男人这种生物产生了恐惧。 如何克服，就考虑当个女优…因为现场人多就不可怕……？（还有这种逻辑？） 果然她也觉得这个方法无效，第2年休业了。  关于当时的人气，夕樹舞子在采访里说到， “去地方做宣传，来到录像店， 我的产品一排排摆在架子上，旁边就是好莱坞大片。我很担心，这样摆放合适吗？” 确是不敢相信的景象，却绝非谎言， 当年几乎所有录像店都为夕树舞子设置了专柜， 就怕客人来了找不到，笑话店长太土。  1996年5月第一次引退，期间出演了影视剧等， 尤其1998年NHK电视剧师，算正式成为演员， 圆了多年的梦，她表示“很开心”。 于是1998年复活（维纳斯厂）， 但仍然不能克服恐惧症，2000年再次引退。  这……屡败屡战屡败可还行？ 也有质疑的声音， 这个理由相当不合理，只能听听算了， 那个年代女优不被世间认可， 谁都不敢说“想出名，想赚钱”之类的， 但后来就都比较坦诚了。 @wqganenshi_  @SexytoBaby @SexytoDoll @SexytoGirl  感谢转发🙏🏻,2025-07-18T00:51:38,398,1,56

Uiteraard helaas zonder publiek, want dat is al helemáál haram (verboden). Zich vrouwelijk kleden en zonder hijab vertonen en dan ook nog eens zingen, is als vrouw in Iran immers levensgevaarlijk.  Parastoo Ahmadi livestreamde haar 'online concert'. Ze zong Perzische volksliederen en enkele hedendaagse Perzische liedjes. Het laatste nummer is een bekend oud Perzisch lied getiteld: 'Tulpen groeien door het bloed van onze kinderen'. 😢  Ze schrijft: 'Ik ben Parastoo, een meisje dat wil zingen voor de mensen waar ze van houdt. Dit is een recht dat ik moet benutten: zingen voor het land waar ik van hou. Hier, op deze historische plek in ons geliefde Iran. Luister naar mijn hypothetisch concert en droom van ons vaderland...'  Ondertussen is er al een klacht tegen haar ingediend bij de tirannieke Islamitische Staat Iran, dus we houden ons hart vast.

twitter/1821192429392769054,"Tot slot over de zaak-Brusselmans (opgelet: lange post!)  Bedreigingen zijn áltijd af te keuren, maar na het lezen van het artikel met de recentste en uitgebreide reactie van Herman Brusselmans, heb ik toch vooral ook medelijden met hem omdat hij zijn compleet gebrek aan kennis etaleert over een conflict waar hij zo'n uitgesproken mening over heeft.  Ik haal er drie zaken uit:  1⃣ Volgens Brusselmans heeft in deze oorlog 'slechts één kamp effectief een leger' (Israël). Dan bewijs je dus dat je werkelijk geen idee hebt van de militaire capaciteiten van Hezbollah en Iran. Bovendien moet men eens leren de 'intentie' onder ogen te zien, en die af te zetten tegen de militaire capaciteiten. Als Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, Qatar enz. morgen hun genocidale intentie laten waren, Israël erkennen binnen veilige grenzen en de wapens neerleggen, dan is er overmorgen vrede en stabiliteit. Als Israël morgen de wapens neerlegt, dan wordt het overmorgen van de kaart geveegd.  2⃣ Volgens Brusselmans gaat het om 'honderdduizenden burgerslachtoffers'. Zelfs Hamas haalt het niet in zijn hoofd om met zo'n potsierlijk cijfer te komen, maar misschien is ook dit een satirische overdrijving die we 'niet 100% letterlijk' moeten nemen. 🤡  Elk burgerslachtoffer is er één te veel, maar de waarheid is dat de verhouding gedode jihadist-burgerslachtoffer in Gaza ongeveer 1 op 1 is (sommigen zeggen 1 op 1,4), wat historisch laag is voor een dergelijke oorlog. Ter vergelijking: in 2016-2017 was in Mosul de verhouding gedode jihadist-burgerslachtoffer ongeveer 1 op 2,5. Hebben we Brusselmans toen zo'n emotioneel geladen column weten schrijven waarin hij zegt dat hij 'iedere Irakees (of moslim!), Koerd of Amerikaan (of christen!) die hij tegenkomt een puntig mes los door de keel wil rammen'?  3⃣ Brusselmans zegt: 'Hamas heeft een politiek van wraak, omdat de Palestijnen al jaar en dag vervolgd worden.' Daarmee miskent hij de oorsprong van Hamas, die deels ligt in de in 1928 in Egypte opgerichte Moslimbroederschap. Daarmee negeert hij het handvest van Hamas en de herhaaldelijke oproepen van Hamas om Israël (en Joden) van de kaart te vegen, en dit niet met een beroep op wraakgevoelens, maar wel op de Koran en de Hadith, de directieven van Allah en de islamitische profeet Mohammed. De 'politiek van wraak' van Hamas is die tegen de eigen bevolking: middels de tirannieke sharia en door mannen, vrouwen en kinderen als levend schild te gebruiken en te hersenspoelen tot antisemitische (zelfmoord)jihadisten. Hamas doet er alles aan om zoveel mogelijk Palestijnen - als 'martelaar' - te laten omkomen, zodat lichtzinnigen als Brusselmans steeds kwader worden op Israël en uiteindelijk op 'de Jood'.  In de jaren 20 van de vorige eeuw, lang dus voor de stichting van Israël, vonden in steden als Jaffa, Nebi Musa, Jerusalem, Hebron, Jenin, Tel Aviv en Haifa reeds de eerste Arabisch-islamitische pogroms op Joden plaats. Sinds 1936 hebben de Palestijnen/Arabieren niet minder dan vijf keer een onafhankelijke Palestijnse geweigerd (dat is gemiddeld één keer om de 17 jaar, de laatste keer was in 2008). Dit deden ze door tegen Israël een vernietigingsoorlog te voeren of in Israël talloze dodelijke jihadaanslagen te plegen op onschuldige burgers.  Tot zegt nog dit. Brusselmans zegt: 'Dit is géén oproep tot geweld, maar bon: wie zijn de Israëli's om zich daar druk in te maken wanneer ze zelf duizenden mensen hebben gedood.'  In elke reactie die Brusselmans geeft, maakt hij het erger, door te veralgemenen op een manier die men nooit zou pikken over een andere bevolkingsgroep, niet het minst moslims. Want hoezo 'de Israëli's'? Alsof er niet genoeg Israëli's zijn die kritiek hebben op Netanyahu en op deze oorlog. Mogen zelfs díe Israëli's zich dan niet druk maken over zijn walgelijke column, die, nogmaals, mocht hij over moslims zijn gegaan, nooit was gepubliceerd? (Niet door Humo, niet door eender welk mainstream medium en allicht zelfs niet door de meeste niet-mainstream media.)  Wegens de oorlog is Brusselmans naar eigen zeggen 'niet meer gek op de joodse cultuur'. Hij gooit álles op één grote simplistische hoop: de Israëli's, de Joodse gemeenschap hier, de Israëlische regering, de joodse cultuur... Brusselmans: 'Als je bombardementen en massavernietiging oké vindt, kan ik niets anders dan besluiten dat ik heel dat joodse gedoe beu ben.' 'Heel dat joodse gedoe': toogpraat in de eerste de beste bruine kroeg is er niks tegen.  Maar misschien zijn ook zijn reacties nu in de pers gewoon allemaal satire en om te lachen, toch, @humo? Brusselmans vraagt zich immers ook af waar 'het joodse relativeringsvermogen naartoe is'. Goh, misschien is dat inderdaad ietsje minder geworden sinds 7 oktober: sinds de Holocaust zijn er op 24u namelijk niet zoveel Joden op één dag vermoord als op die bewuste dag. Misschien is het joodse relativeringsvermogen ook wat minder geworden sinds het aantal antisemitische incidenten de pan uitswingt en in Antwerpen zelfs Joodse schoolkinderen worden belaagd? Of sinds ook in het Westen de Hamas-adepten zich meer dan ooit laten zien, op straat en op de universiteit. Of sinds Joden ook in het Westen niet zelden het eerste doelwit zijn van moslimterroristen (denk bijvoorbeeld het Joods museum).  Onwetendheid, of domheid, wordt nog erger wanneer het wordt gecombineerd met een gebrek aan empathie.  Misschien kan Brusselmans, in de momenten dat hij niet aan het schrijven is over iemand 'achterwaarts in de poes naaien', het 'Manifeste contre le nouvel antisémitisme' lezen, waarin wordt gesteld dat er alleen al uit de regio Parijs 50.000 Joden (!) zijn weggevlucht wegens islamitisch antisemitisme ($URL[0] Niet in de jaren 30, maar vandaag, in de 21e eeuw.  Als het in onze contreien zo voortgaat, niet alleen wat de import van gewelddadig, jihadistisch antisemitisme betreft, maar ook met mensen - politici, journalisten, BV's - als Brusselmans die in mainstream media hun Jodenhaat mogen spuien, dan zal onze samenleving op termijn Judenrein worden.  Zeker wanneer ze tegelijkertijd zo laf zijn dat ze de islam niet meer te bespotten of bekritiseren, want zoals Brusselmans zelf zei in 2018: 'Met de moslims pas ik toch op. Theo Van Gogh is dan ook doodgeschoten, hé. Maar ik wil wel nog op een onnozele manier kunnen schrijven over mijn lief en mijn tante Sonja.'  Frits Bolkestein sprak bijna 15 jaar geleden al de vrees uit dat, vanwege het groeiende antisemitisme, er voor orthodoxe en andere herkenbare joden hier geen toekomst is. Helaas lijkt hij steeds meer gelijk te gaan krijgen.  📰 Hier de link naar het artikel over Brusselmans waarvan sprake 👇 $URL[1]",2024-08-07T22:31:25,572,77,148

twitter/1867270250821017907,"GAZA DEPARTURE DIARY: Departing Gaza and seeing all of this is somehow more emotionally charged than other days. Its more painful, angering, as the sheer madness of what is happening here collides with the injustice of my being able to leave.   Who sat in that armchair? My mind imagines a grandfather surrounded by little ones. My imagination tries to reconstruct stories. The little girl playing in the sand, where are her parents? Where is she from?   Why does the father waving at me when he sees me filming out the window make my eyes burn with tears that don’t fall?   Note: I left Gaza a week ago. As I write this I’m listening to Jake Sullivan out of Tel Aviv, saying that the US looking to close a hostage-ceasefire deal. A journalist is asking about Hamas taking the aid. Part of me wants to laugh that this narrative is still out there and a bigger part of me just wants to shake everyone and I am at a loss, how do we make people see reality? Is it even possible against the backdrop of the Israeli and US machines ?   “Feeding starving children does not harm the state of Isreal” Sullivan just said. Except starving children are not being fed, and have not been fed. And in fact have been going hungrier and hungrier. Let me give you one example, eggs showed up my last few days in Gaza. A tray of two dozen cost $65. People are being suffocated at bread lines, while I was there a woman and two girls were crushed to death, that’s how hungry and desperate people are. Aid organizations are having to make the grotesque calculation – given the ridiculously low number of aid trucks getting in – to tell people “sorry we cant help with winterizing shelter, we have to prioritize flour”. Go cold and wet or go hungry. What sort of absurdity is that?",2024-12-13T02:08:14,456,23,344

twitter/1827276826651087221,"I think there are a lot of “Kennedy Republicans” out there. Former Democrats who do not recognize their party anymore. I am one.  Kennedy Republicans are the voters who used to call ourselves liberals and progressives because we care about free speech, protecting the vulnerable, championing the environment, and fighting for the American family.   @RobertKennedyJr’s endorsement of @realDonaldTrump is a classic case of Ronald Reagan’s famous “I didn’t leave the Democratic party, the party left me.” He’s not alone.   And that’s because the Democratic Party on display at the @DNC convention was top heavy in rich, elite scolds who think they are better and know better.  Self-satisfied censors, comfortable with authoritarian edicts about our healthcare, hypocrites about public education and cavalier about our kids curriculum morphing into left wing indoctrination sessions who still prefer dangerous Defund the Police policies over Law and Order.   They have betrayed classic liberal values by refusing to engage in IDEAS, debate opponents and the shameful efforts to keep Kennedy off the ballot.  The @GOP is not perfect but they look awfully good in comparison. And, at least for now, it is a two party system. I think RFK Jr. is right on this one. America can’t afford a “Brat” President who won’t articulate or defend her policies in interviews or debate.   The @VP’s price control proposal went over like a lead balloon and she dropped it from her convention speech, but she has been openly pushing Marxist ideas like “Equality of Outcome” and Open Borders in theory and practice. She has a record.   Kennedy Republicans has a good ring to it. So does #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.",2024-08-24T17:28:39,9465,680,1930

However, they were met with a brutal response.  Russian fighters let the enemy enter one of the buildings, where they were already waiting in concealed positions. Everything was timed to the second—no panic, no mistakes. Once the assault team was trapped, the “Mad Dogs” struck first: most of the group was instantly eliminated, and those who tried to escape were finished off outside.  Yet another meat-grinder assault by Kiev forces ended in total disaster—Drapaty’s troops became expendable in his quest for more stars on his epaulettes.  Mission accomplished. Mad Dogs.

Instead they work to actively thwart any attempt at accountability, protect the incompetent leadership, and make excuses for an agency completely paralyzed by bureaucracy, politics, and waste.  Which makes people believe that they don’t actually care about transit at all, but instead are either lobbyists paid to maintain the status quo, or ideologues who just want to funnel money into political patronage via government agencies.

twitter/1869331133676294343,“中美联手解决世界问题”：是愿景，还是白日梦？  特朗普大言不惭地说，中美要是联手了，能解决世界上的所有问题。这话听起来挺励志，像是超级英雄电影的开场白，但细想一下，不免让人觉得这话实在“离谱得体面”。毕竟，世界上的许多问题，不正是美国一手制造的吗？更别提，中美两国之间的问题本身就够世界操心的了。连自己的“家务事”都理不清，还谈什么拯救地球？这就像一个失控的消防员跑来安慰邻居：“别怕，我会帮你扑灭我放的火！”  美国：世界问题的“创作者”与“投资人”  如果把世界问题比作商业电影，美国绝对是最大制作方。从剧本创作到后期特效，它都全程参与，还总爱抢“正义一方”的主角。问题是，这些“电影”拍得又长又乱，结局从来不圆满，倒是副作用特别多——战争、混乱、危机一个都不少。  1.中东：美国的“战争大片”宇宙  中东问题堪称美国的“招牌系列”。从伊拉克到叙利亚，美国一边号称要带去“自由”，一边用导弹和无人机投下无数灾难。结果呢？民主没见到，石油偷了不少，难民倒成了片尾的标配。把人家国家炸成一片废墟，还能转身说“看，他们好乱哦”，这样的编剧水平只能说是离谱。  2.欧洲：北约的地缘政治“大片”  俄乌冲突的剧情就更熟悉了，美国“扶持乌克兰、激怒俄罗斯”的剧本写了20多年。结果是，乌克兰成了战争片的拍摄地，欧洲则被拖进能源危机。你以为美国关心欧洲的安危？其实它只想让北约“订阅人数”一直增长而已，至于欧洲观众爱不爱看，它一点也不在乎。  3.亚太：美国的“冒险剧”试验场  在亚太，美国对中国的遏制像极了老套的反派桥段：从炒作“南海威胁”，到对台湾问题插手，戏码一场接一场。美国表面上说“保护区域和平”，实则打的是“搅局”的算盘。这种既当裁判又当运动员的操作，怎么看都像个技术粗糙的流量演员。  一句话，美国制造问题一把好手，解决问题却总是把“烂摊子”甩给别人。如果美国真有心解决世界问题，不妨先把自己“拍”进正确的剧本里，别总是“反派装主角”了。  中美关系：别说解决问题，先解决自己  特朗普的“联手说”另一个逻辑漏洞是——中美两国连自己的关系都乱得像八点档家庭伦理剧。连彼此看对眼都难，怎么就想拯救地球了？  1.价值观分歧：两套剧本，两个导演  中美这两个“大制片厂”，剧本压根写得不一样。美国拍的是“霸权续集”，中国写的是“自主发展”。两边一个想抢资源，一个想壮实力，价值观碰撞得火花四溅，这合作想怎么谈？难道要比谁的演员阵容强？  2.经济对抗：一场没有硝烟的竞标赛  贸易战、科技封锁、供应链脱钩……美国为了“压制中国票房”，各种手段层出不穷，而中国则是另辟蹊径，靠“经济合作”和“基建狂魔”走上国际舞台。这边刀光剑影，那边一带一路，中美“联手”的画面怎么看都很魔幻。  3.信任破裂：零和博弈没赢家  中美之间已经不是“谁信谁”的问题，而是“谁更不信谁”。美国嘴上喊着气候合作，转头就在军事、经济上打压中国。就这种“前台握手、后台下手”的操作，合作能玩得下去？那真是奇迹了。  世界问题：不是喊“联手”就能解决的  特朗普的“中美合作解决世界问题”听着像高端外交词汇，但实际呢？这句口号忽略了一个基本事实——世界问题没那么简单，也不是靠中美俩“巨头”摆个pose就能搞定的。  1.问题复杂，得靠多边合作  气候变化、疫情、能源危机……这些可不是单纯靠“大佬发号施令”就能解决的事儿。光靠中美两国，最多也就是喊喊口号，真正能解决问题的，是多边机制和实打实的国际合作。中美顶多是“组团打怪”的一部分，不可能包办一切。  2.美国得先“收起自己的拳头”  如果美国真想合作，那首先得学会“不惹事”。天天在国际舞台上给别人挖坑，完事儿再喊“大家齐心协力填坑”，这不等于耍流氓吗？别忘了，合作的前提是互信，而不是靠威胁和强迫。  结语：拯救地球，不如先管好自己  特朗普那句“中美联手解决世界问题”，听着有点像励志电影的台词，但现实比电影复杂得多。中美两国一个制造问题成瘾，一个忙着发展自己的新路子，合作的前提压根就不成立。  世界问题需要解决，但不是靠两个超级大国“演戏”就能搞定的。合作需要诚意，多边主义才是答案。与其说“联手解决”，不如建议美国先学会“不捣乱”，然后再谈合作的事儿。毕竟，连自己火烧眉毛的事都没解决，就别忙着当“世界消防员”了。,2024-12-18T18:37:27,1,0,1

twitter/1938760734739177911,00 后视角闲扯，如何看待生育问题？——孩子是一种消费品  上次聊房子，我抛出个暴论：没生育和买房需求，正常打工的钱咋都够花，买房就是伪需求。评论区炸了，有人说：“房子、生育都是伪需求，人类还繁衍吗？” 伪需求这词不精准，孩子准确的定位是——消费品  最早在猫笔刀公众号看到对孩子的这个定义，惊为天人：“新生儿数量减少不像房价的下跌那么直观紧迫……孩子在现代家庭中的角色其实是消费品，孩子数量减少本质上就是家庭消费收缩。”  为什么孩子成消费品了呢？这恐怕又是新老观念的冲突。老一辈的 “传宗接代” 观念到 00 后这里早已相对薄弱。宗族和家族的结构逐渐解体，正常情况下普通人也没啥家业要继承，个体更关注自身的生活，而非家族整体的传承，所以生育的责任感约等于零  加之各种红利消退——人口是一种红利，增长放缓了红利消退；科技进步是一种红利，互联网乃至区块链行业的红利都在退潮——个体生存压力骤增。顾好自己都难的情况下，一个三口之家的孩子要承担四位老人 + 两位中老年人的赡养义务。这种情况下，如果还生一个孩子，对普通人来说压力可想而知  拿 “养儿防老” 的保险投资逻辑来说呢？很显然，这并不是一种多么理想的投资。计算了下在上海养孩子到大学毕业要多少钱，按中档投入，需要花 300 万以上养到 23/24 岁大学毕业，粗略按毕业后每月净收入 12 万，25 年回本。这一点 @keyahayek Kay 神也讨论过相似的话题，普通人的一生，在中国目前来看也就能赚 400～1500 万人民币  何况养孩子并不只是金钱的投入，还有时间、精力、心血和情绪的消耗。一生，工作 50 年左右，等孩子能赚钱回馈父母的时候，父母恐怕早已垂垂老矣  如果把孩子当成投资，养娃追求的是回本和养老保障，无疑对自己和对孩子来说，生与育都会带点折磨。所以，孩子这类 “彩票” 只有在消费品定位下才值得生——当有一定财务基础、养娃无压力时，孩子才从一场可能亏本的投资变成了爱情的结晶、血脉的传承，和对未来的期待  而究竟这种消费品是刚需还是非必要，决定权在自己手上,2025-06-28T08:45:54,234,129,17

twitter/1850903064989024386,"Justin Trudeau is in freefall, and his own party is finally starting to see it. After years of scandal, mismanagement, and hollow promises, even Trudeau’s staunchest supporters are beginning to wonder if he’s more liability than leader. According to a new Angus Reid poll, the Prime Minister’s grip on his own party is weakening at a rapid pace. His Liberals are fractured, and he’s facing something almost unheard of for a Canadian leader: an open mutiny from within. More than 20 of his own MPs are calling for him to step aside, making it clear that the loyalty he once enjoyed is eroding fast.  Now, if you listen to the spin from Liberal headquarters, they’ll tell you Trudeau’s support base is still intact. They point to the fact that over half of Canadians—about 55%—could consider voting Liberal in the next election. But let’s cut through that nonsense. “Considering” isn’t committing, and only 21% of decided voters actually support the Liberals today. That’s right—barely a fifth of voters with a clear preference want Trudeau back. It’s like the emperor has no clothes, and even the diehard Liberals are finally starting to admit it.  But let’s dig a little deeper, because even that 55% figure, flimsy as it is, doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. A significant number of these potential Liberal voters want Trudeau gone. In fact, more than half of the voters who might consider the Liberals want a new leader. They’re sick of Trudeau’s excuses, his apologies, his endless gaffes. They’re tired of watching Canada become a punchline. Yet Trudeau soldiers on, hoping his half-hearted charisma and empty promises can somehow carry him through one more election cycle.  Why does he think he can cling to power? It might just be because the Liberals have no one else waiting in the wings. And when I say “no one,” I mean no one credible. Sure, there’s Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who’s been talked up as the heir apparent. But Freeland isn’t exactly lighting up the polls; she’s popular only among Trudeau’s inner circle and a handful of Liberal insiders. Canadians aren’t buying it. She’s seen as more of the same, another elite politician with little connection to the real issues facing the average Canadian.  Then there’s Mark Carney, former Bank of Canada Governor, being floated as Trudeau’s potential successor. Carney is the closest thing to a palatable option, but even he lacks the kind of broad support needed to rescue the Liberals from the mess they’re in. And let’s not forget Christy Clark, the former B.C. Premier who’s shown interest in the job. Her popularity, if you can even call it that, barely registers. This is the state of Trudeau’s Liberal Party—no leadership, no vision, and no credible plan for the future.  And then we have the NDP, Trudeau’s supposed “partner” in his shaky government. The Liberals’ supply-and-confidence agreement with the NDP was meant to keep Trudeau in power, but it’s done little more than expose just how vulnerable he really is. NDP voters are far from loyal; in fact, they’re open to jumping ship under the right conditions. Translation: they’re waiting for someone—anyone—besides Trudeau. Meanwhile, Jagmeet Singh, the NDP leader, is struggling with a meager 37% favorability rating. The NDP isn’t exactly a safe harbor; it’s just the only one some voters see right now. Trudeau’s alliance with the NDP isn’t bringing him the stability he hoped for. If anything, it’s a reminder of how few options he has left.  So, where does this leave the Liberal Party? With a leader who’s overstayed his welcome, no viable replacement, and a base that’s more divided by the day. Trudeau’s Liberals are teetering on the edge. They can either take a long, hard look in the mirror and cut ties with a Prime Minister who’s out of touch with reality, or they can keep clinging to a man who’s leading them straight toward irrelevance.  Canada deserves better than this swampy mess. Trudeau and his Liberals are running on borrowed time, and Canadians are waking up to the need for a real, unapologetic voice for freedom and sanity. If the Liberals can’t provide it—and let’s be real, they can’t—Canadians have every reason to look elsewhere. Trudeau’s days are numbered, and if he doesn’t realize it soon, his party will be going down with him.",2024-10-28T22:10:53,588,63,239
twitter/1934973092809642164,"Ottawa, June 17, 2025 – Canada's economic crisis took center stage yesterday as the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance (FINA) erupted into fierce debate over the Liberal government’s refusal to deliver a federal budget before summer. A Conservative motion demanding fiscal transparency exposed sharp partisan fault lines on inflation, energy, crime, and mass immigration—highlighting why voters stripped the Liberals of their majority and handed the opposition a clear mandate to hold them accountable.  Conservatives Blasts Liberal Mismanagement  Let’s be honest—Canada is on the brink. The numbers don’t lie: inflation’s exploding, debt’s out of control, and food banks are overwhelmed. So what does the Trudeau–Carney regime do? Delay the budget. Again. Because transparency is the last thing they want. But one Conservative isn’t having it.  Conservative MP Jasraj Hallan delivered a torpedo straight into the heart of Liberal mismanagement, demanding the Finance Minister table a real budget before Parliament breaks for the summer. Not a press release. Not a tweet. A budget. Imagine that.  Hallan tabled a motion demanding that the Minister of Finance present a full federal budget before Parliament’s summer recess, citing spiraling inflation, surging debt, and widespread public hardship. He painted a grim picture of an economy in turmoil, laying blame squarely on Liberal policies that have led to the highest inflation rate in the G7, a 7% unemployment rate, doubled housing costs, and a doubling in food bank usage across the country.  Hallan condemned the carbon tax, Bill C-48 (tanker ban), and Bill C-69 (impact assessment) as deliberate attacks on Canada’s energy sector—warning they could cost over 110,000 jobs, according to Deloitte, and have already driven $600 billion in investment south of the border. He pointed to the government's $486 billion in main estimates and $600 billion in planned spending as evidence of reckless fiscal management, warning that the $1.27 trillion national debt risks triggering tax hikes or a credit downgrade.  “Canadians are desperate to know the state of the nation’s finances,” Hallan declared, noting that families are skipping meals and newcomers are sleeping in cars or under bridges. He accused the Liberals of stalling, shifting from denying the need for a budget to floating a “mini-budget” only after mounting Conservative pressure—suggesting the delays are a cover for deeper fiscal mismanagement.  And if that wasn’t enough, Hallan connected the dots between the Liberals’ mass immigration agenda and the housing collapse. He cited the Bank of Canada’s own warnings that population surges—engineered by this government—are making housing unaffordable for everyone. Fewer homes. Higher prices. More strain. And for what? “To get more votes,” Hallan said  As a former newcomer himself, Hallan contrasted Canada’s past affordability—when “one paycheck could cover a household”—with today’s realities, accusing the Liberals of using immigration policy as a political tool to “get more votes” while leaving both Canadians and newcomers without jobs, housing, or access to basic services.  Hallan called for a budget now—not in the fall, not when it’s politically convenient. One that includes a real plan on immigration and housing. Because that’s what Canada needs to get back on track: truth, fiscal sanity, and a government that serves the people—not itself.  Liberal Excuses and Mulroney Misfire: Budget Dodge Sparks Backlash  So what’s the Liberal excuse this time? Ryan Turnbull, ever the loyal foot soldier for Trudeau’s ex-banker heir Mark Carney, tried to defend the government's refusal to deliver a spring budget by invoking—wait for it—Brian Mulroney. Yes, Liberals now want us to believe that Carney’s fragile, scandal-soaked minority is somehow comparable to Mulroney’s 1984 Conservative juggernaut that swept 211 of 282 seats.  Turnbull’s argument? There’s “no statutory requirement” to deliver a budget quickly. Translation: 'We’re not legally obligated to be transparent, so we won’t be.' He even tried to water down the Conservative motion by proposing a toothless amendment that just says “please table a budget”—without a deadline. Pathetic.  But then came the reality check—not from the Conservatives, but from Bloc Québécois MP Denis Trudel, who torched the Mulroney comparison as both outdated and irrelevant. Trudel reminded the committee that he was two years old when Mulroney was elected—back in a time when public servants still had integrity and deficits were measured in billions, not trillions.  Mulroney inherited a Liberal-made $37.2 billion deficit and had the strength of a parliamentary majority to wait. This Liberal government has no majority, no mandate, and no excuse for hiding a $486 billion spending spree and a $1.27 trillion debt from Canadians.  This isn’t 1984. It’s 2025. The country is facing mass immigration pressures, a housing collapse, record food bank usage, and runaway inflation. And the Liberals want to delay a budget while quoting 40-year-old history books?  Bill C-4 Delays and Broader Policy Clashes  Turnbull expressed frustration that the motion debate delayed discussion on Bill C-4, a tax relief bill unanimously supported in the House, which FINA must review. He proposed an in-camera session to prioritize Bill C-4, underscoring the Liberal focus on voter-backed relief. The delay highlights minority parliament dynamics, where opposition motions disrupt government priorities, fulfilling the public’s mandate for scrutiny.  Hallan accused Liberal “soft on crime” policies, specifically Bills C-5 and C-75, of enabling repeat offenders, contributing to a 300% surge in extortions, and making Canada a “safe haven for criminals.” He demanded repeal to prioritize victims. On energy, Hallan called for scrapping anti-energy laws to make Canada an “energy superpower,” claiming Liberal restrictions favor foreign dictators over workers. Liberals sidestepped crime and immigration critiques, emphasizing Bill C-4 and their platform’s affordability measures. The debate showcased contrasting visions: Conservatives urging immediate action, versus Liberals banking on strategic planning.  Final Thoughts: A Plan Without a Plan Is Still a Plan—to Fail  Let’s stop pretending this is incompetence. It’s not. It’s a strategy. The Liberals aren’t lost. They’re executing—badly, cynically, and destructively—but executing nonetheless.  They don’t have a plan to fix Canada because this is their plan: Make energy unaffordable. Flood the housing market. Soften the justice system. Inflate the currency. Drive up debt. Import votes. Blame the weather. Rinse and repeat.  They knew the books were bad a year ago. That’s why Chrystia Freeland ran for the hills, dropped the Finance portfolio, and pretended to “stand with Canadians” while the ship was already halfway underwater. Now Trudeau’s gone, Carney’s in, and nothing’s changed—because it was never about who’s at the podium. It’s about the machine.  So here we are: food bank lines, unaffordable homes, skyrocketing crime, and a government refusing to produce a budget before summer while $600 billion vanishes and a $1.27 trillion debt hangs over our heads.  When pressed, they quote Mulroney. They call for closed-door sessions. They talk about affordability while pushing policies that make life unaffordable for everyone except themselves.  So here’s the bottom line: if this is the best the Liberals have got—and it is—then Conservatives need to hammer this message home. Relentlessly.  Because frankly, that Toronto-Ottawa bubble still doesn’t get it. They’ll keep sleepwalking through the collapse unless someone spells it out: this isn’t accidental. It’s ideological.  Just saying “build the pipeline” isn’t enough anymore. Conservatives need to make it crystal clear: They need expose the plan (or lack of it). Name it. Shame it. And make sure every Canadian knows: the Liberal agenda is not a plan to govern. It’s a plan to fail. And we’re all living in the wreckage.",2025-06-17T21:55:10,282,11,149

Why?   The CPI measures hundreds of different products and takes a composite of the price changes for all of them.    But the “must pay” routine bills are rising a lot faster than the bills for more elective expenditures. The chart below shows what the biggest price increases have been. Gasoline prices are up 36%, rent is up 32%, eggs, cereal, coffee, used cars are up about 20% and electricity and utilities are up 22%.    ￼  Meanwhile, cell phones, information technology, televisions, computers, and communications have fallen in price. But in this financially stressed environment, food, gas, eggs, and rent are more important to the average family budget than TVs or computers.   The average price rise for food, gas, rent, and electricity are up more than 25%, not 15%.",2023-08-12T23:51:44,8,4,6

twitter/1813945067926671617,"🚨If you want to climb into the mind of Joe Biden or the Biden family at this time .... think about all of this from Joe Biden's eyes and his own lived experience.   At the end of the summer of 1972, his Senate campaign pollster, Pat Caddell, commissioned an internal poll.  Caddell came back with the results over Labor Day weekend and the #DESEN race stood at:  BOGGS:  47% BIDEN:     19%  Biden wasn't taken seriously and told by everyone that he had no chance to win the Senate seat in 1972. Even his own adviser and new friend (Kauffman) told him that he couldn't win. His challenge to Senator Boggs was dismissed as cute and quixotic. He was just a young gadfly out to raise his name ID and political profile. He had NO CHANCE of beating Caleb Boggs - a popular incumbent Senator, former Governor, and Congressman - universally BELOVED by everyone in in the small state of Delaware - who was running on a ticket with a very popular President Richard Nixon at the top!    On Election Day, Nixon won the state of Delaware with 60% of the vote that cycle. But it marked the first of many times that Joe Biden would defy gravity (political and otherwise) as he would slip by Nixon's nationwide landslide and make what most thought impossible possible - winning 50.5% of the vote and defeating the incumbent.   BOGGS  49.1% BIDEN     50.5%  ✅  Now ... plug-in that triumph to the entire tapestry of Joe Biden's life and career and the chapters of Joe Biden's life and career, defined by setbacks and resilience  1942-1959 Overcame a childhood stutter and the mockery and bullying accompanied with it 1972 Unlikely Senate Win 1972 Survived the heartache and loss from the death of Neilia and Naomi 1987 Humiliated by accusations of plagiarism and forced to withdrawal from the 88' Presidential race at age 45 in what looked like could be the end of his political career 1987  Led the defeat of Bork's nomination to SCOTUS 1988 Catholic Priest attempt to deliver him the last rites while suffering from the burst of an aneurysm on an artery wall at the base of the brain / given 50% chance of surviving  1991 Became the poster-child responsible for the treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearing and roundly criticized for decades for his handling of the hearings 2007 Loses a second campaign for the Presidency 2008 Selected as Barack Obama's running mate and ultimate the Vice President 2014-2015 Obama and company make clear that Hillary Clinton is the heir apparent and blesses much of his team/operation over to the Clinton Campaign in-waiting. Obama would not be endorsing his own VP for President that cycle.  2015  Suffers the death of his second child, his son Beau 2015 Obama makes additional attempts to push Biden away from running in 2016 2019 Obama does not endorse his own VP (again) and stays neutral in the 2020 Democratic Primary 2019  As Biden begins to assemble campaign team to launch his third run, they're hit with accusations from Lucey Flores before he evens gets off the ground 2020  A former VP is crushed by Democrats in the Iowa Caucus, New Hampshire Primary, and Nevada Caucus 2020  South Carolina Primary gave him wings 2021  Biden becomes 46 2021-2024  Wildly successful first term and most productive and effective President (in terms of deliverables) since LBJ.  2022 Biden's party avoids the expected midterm thumping and historically overperforms.

twitter/1832643386991636704,战友们好，关于数字银行群集体诉讼的事，我还要补充两点。  一、这件事的起因是哈密尔顿公平基金给投资人发了一封邮件，建议投资人联系Woodward律师，参与对DOJ的集体诉讼（视频1是数字银行群里转发的这封邮件的中文翻译版本）。  这封邮件有一点很诡异，因为一些战友说收到了这封邮件，一些战友说没收到。难道这封邮件不是群发的？  这使我不得不联想到一项技术：冒充第三方给一个人发邮件。而且某宝就有这个服务，一封邮件1500rmb，而且也不支持群发。  二、即使是像我上个帖子中说的那样：单独立案起诉DOJ，也大概率会被并案到七哥的案子里。  因为七哥说过数字银行投资款在Silvergate银行。而在七哥案子的起诉书的第41、42、43页（$URL[0] ），我们可以清晰地看见，DOJ总计冻结了哈密尔顿公平基金在Silvergate银行389038597.04美元现金（截图1）。   这里面肯定是包含数字银行投资款。所以即使我们单独立案，也会被并案到七哥的案子里。,2024-09-08T12:53:26,94,13,60
twitter/1886091894356398229,战友们好，虽说在一个链上发行一个币很容易。但要让它真正进入市场流通、实现自由交易，那可就不是一件简单的事了。  首先第一步定发行价，就很难。为什么难呢？因为要先有人掏钱提供流动性，比如Trump的币子，发行前要先拿出几千万USDC，和Trump币在DEX（去中心化交易所）形成一个交易池子。   具体来说，Trump总统的这个币子，它的总供应量为 10 亿枚。 在发行的第一天，初始发行量为 2 亿枚，初始价格为 0.1824 美元。那就要有人先拿出2亿乘以0.1824左右的USDC，和这2亿枚Trump币子形成一个交易池子。   有了这个池子，大家才可以买卖。具体什么逻辑呢？  现在池子里有2亿Trump币子，还有几千万USDC。如果你想买Trump币，那你就往这个池子里放USDC，然后有一个算法（DLMM）会计算出该给你多少Trump币，最直接的算法就是按比例来计算。这就形成了初始发行价0.1824美金。  然后发行的前两天，大家都想买Trump币，所以池子里的USDC会越来越多，而Trump币会越来越少，于是Trump币就涨价了。   上面这套流程就是在DEX（去中心化交易所）上发币的方式，可以看到没有第三方参与。甚至第二方都没了，只有你和池子。大家可以再对比喜币的发行方式：由发行方给买家提供配额。   Trump币使用的去中心化交易所主要是Meteora。因为有很多去中心化交易所，如何选择最优的价格，这就需要用到一个叫Jupiter的产品。也就是Moonshot（Trump币推荐购买方式）。 Jupiter 官方 X 也在发币当天发文：通过与 Meteora 团队密切合作，确保 TRUMP 的完美发行，这显然是加密历史上最大的发行之一。 链接： $URL[0]   所以在经过这一系列极其复杂的操作之后，大家才可以用Moonshot轻松购买Trump币。  最后，上面这些新鲜的操作在DEX里都是很重要的，因为价格是算法决定的，不是人。交易过程中极有可能产生滑点，损失巨大，比如你想一块钱买币子，结果成交价变成了1.2，啥也没干，直接损失20%，这都是一个战友跟我叙述的亲身经历。,2025-02-03T00:38:44,53,5,24

twitter/1734979764992233961,#初码观察 今天顺着大兵@DaBingJingDuo 单挑民运泼妇们的事说一下我对海外民运的看法，一句话总结就是：一个人无论什么政治立场，无论什么宗教信仰，无论在何时何地，获得尊重的方式，一定是自己的学识和教养，而不是头上的意识形态帽子。  首先要声明一下我的忠诚立场，我坚决的拥护中国共产党，坚决的反对海外民运运动，不同意这句话的可以不用往下看了。  好了，下面进入正题，说一下我的观点：  一、民运不是挡箭牌，任何人做事说话，都要遵循基本的做人做事原则  我们常说一句话，面子是自己凑上来丢的，这句话用在大部分民运人士身上再合适不过了，他们在多年的运动生涯中，一点一点的把自己的脸面、信用耗尽，究其原因，就是不遵循基本的做人做事原则，包括：  1、讲真话，不要造谣  89运动后，一大帮去美国的民运人士，典型的如何频节目的那一批嘉宾，十年如一日的用他们30年前的见闻+道听途说的消息+意淫臆测，从中南海秘闻到社会与经济论断，能脱口而出各种离谱、不切实际甚至荒诞的结论。  一个人的信用是很宝贵的，如果说错或者预测错了某个事，那一定是先道歉才能继续说话，这是最基本的做人原则，但他们呢，对这种满嘴跑火车的行为已经习惯甚至毫无负罪感，这显然是极其恶劣的品性。  2、评价一件事，不要意识形态化，要具体化，要有上下文，要讲逻辑  如果说低级民运是脏话家、听床师之流，那很多更优雅一些的高级民运，则是智商跟不上，完全没有现代科学的思考逻辑和精神。  评价一件事的方法论，包括具体化、上下文、讲逻辑，这其实是很讲究的，也是一个人逻辑能力的体现，而相当数量的民运人士都会在上面栽跟头，当然了，说个题外话，白左们大多也落入这个陷阱，只是在这一点上，海外民运们，有过之而无不及。  这里讲一下典型的新疆问题，在新疆问题上，海外民运的典型方法论就是：因为我看到了有学习营的石锤，所以这就是种族灭绝，就是没有人权。  拜托，连中共都公开承认学习营的存在，那你为啥就不能多想想这些事情的前因后果呢？事实上新疆问题很简单，就是：伊斯兰意识形态在新疆地区长期的散养过程中，因为其宗教本身的特性，结合新疆独特的区域特性，不可避免的陷入了以宗教主导为核心的区域独立化运动，而伊斯兰加持后，在这场运动中，又不出意外的引入了恐怖主义思潮和行为，最终升级为东突厥主义伊斯兰抵抗运动与中国共产党政权的对抗。  而中共又是一个在维护领土完整以及维护政权稳定上，执行力相当坚决的政党，所以这才有了各种新疆事件的发生，以及后来的强制学习集中营。  你可以批评中共在具体行动上的缺点和不周全，但是你如果无头无脑、不考虑任何前因后果的指着鼻子骂他故意在搞种族灭绝，那不好意思，你真的得不到任何尊重，因为在你的脑子里，已经没有一丁点思考的能力。  学习营的逻辑其实也很简单，那就是这些数百万的人，脑子里全部都是伊斯兰教义，大部分人的科学文化知识很差，几乎没有现代社会的意识，那放他在社会上，我控不住，而这些都是成年人了，也没有办法再走一遍正规的教育体系，怎么办呢，只能放到一个半监狱状态的地方，学习基本课程，考核通过后离开，能救一个是一个。  什么叫科学的方法论，就是你可以批评中共解决伊斯兰主义泛滥所采用的学习营的方式有问题，并且你可以给出具体的解决办法，但是你不能无脑，最重要的是，不能无证据的来大谈特谈种族灭绝。  甚至这个话题，我们可以开个不恰当的玩笑话，中国历史上，五胡、西域阿拉伯、蒙古、大清等等，都搞过规模很大的对汉族的种族灭绝，反而汉族还真是中华大地历史上相对比较温顺的民族主体，甚至你可以拿文革来说中国人的劣根性，但是这么大一片土地上，1949年以后，无论是哪个省份的人，无论是哪个层级的领导者，主动要发起对种族的仇视并要对种族灭绝的基因是不存在的。  以上对于新疆种族灭绝的讨论，就是一个典型的考虑上下文也讲道理的思考逻辑，只有这样去辩论，去研究，去发言，才能获得别人的尊重。而这种获得尊重的方式，不是中国特有的，也是全世界普适的。  再比如对于伊斯兰的讨论，如果你只谈所谓整体宗教人权，不谈具体的宗教细节，那也毫无意义，比如说说我所了解的宁夏白帽子们，在宁夏地区，大小阿訇或者说围绕阿訇的伊斯兰社会运转体系，就是一个不得不正视的存在，比如影响、干涉政府公务员的任命，比如更严重的如牛羊进贡、斋捐、建寺摊牌、丧捐等等，这些都是严重违背现代社会治理架构反人类的存在。  如果你讨论所谓的穆斯林人权的时候，不去考虑这些问题，那就只是空中阁楼，没有任何意义。  转头再来到巴以冲突，看到没，这就是白左们在全世界引导圣母意识形态思潮下，西方世界自己种下的恶果，甚至从白左媒体开始，没有人关心巴勒斯坦的具体问题和具体灾难，只是像复读机一样，一遍又一遍的重复这些没有上下文的巴勒斯坦人权，在这个角度看，以色列的苦又有谁懂，明明是非常讲逻辑讲规划的反击、进攻、和平、发展策略，但仍然得不到大部分人的支持，开玩笑的说，此刻中共也可以共情一下吧。  3、不结党营私是放眼全世界的优良品德  目前乌烟瘴气的社交媒体上，不仅是简中圈，甚至是全世界，结党营私已经是最大的癌症，我们套用唐国强大帝的一句话：“要以朋党为戒，为什么呀？因为一旦结成朋党，不管近在咫尺，还是远在万里，朋比交故，牢不可破，祸端丛生；是其党者，不管贤与不贤，就百般庇护，不是一党，不管好与不好，就百般攻击”。  海外民运们，大部分都有结党的问题，讲话做事先不看逻辑，先站队，先大谈特谈立场，只要是立场一致，盟友的任何东西都可以护成好的，只要立场对立，就想方设法的扣帽子和人身攻击。  还是新疆问题，很多民运的立场就是，因为你中共种族灭绝，所以支持新疆独立的东突厥斯坦，我就要坚决支持，拜托，你真的是脑子坏了，你知道东突是啥玩意吗？和哈马斯有啥本质区别？安史之乱是啥样子你没看过吗？哪怕我们说不要老想着古老的仇恨，但是作为汉族，传统的华夏地区出身的民运人士们，你们能长长脑子吗，能多思考思考吗？  同样的道理放在法轮功身上也一样，一个教义靠东拼西凑意淫捏造、核心团队极尽敛财奢靡、时不时胡说八道死四亿人、劝说信徒生病打坐害死无数人的邪教，难不成因为他反中共，和你立场一致，你就要支持他？哪怕他说了不对的话你也要为他辩解？  二、高高在上的民运，不如脚踏实地的做事  上一节说了基本品德，看似言辞激烈，但其实这还只是最基本的东西，一个人得到尊重，更重要的是脚踏实地的生活和工作。  1、不要为了民运而民运  目前海外民运，相当数量的人，陷入了一个怪圈，自己长期脱离正常的社会，已经失去了做其他事情的能力，一切工作，都围绕民运开展，而更离谱的是，原本是帮助全体中国人民的民运，因为他们长期盘踞海外，与国内几乎完全脱节，也帮不上任何忙，他们除了嘴也没胆量去帮具体的忙，而海外大部分都是勤劳工作的传统中国人，与民运有关的极少。最后僧多粥少，愈演愈烈到这个民运圈子里的很多人要靠搞假政治庇护来牟利，这就不用我都说了，人命案都搞出来一个。  你说这可笑不，这可悲不，如果你有一份靠自己的才能或者体力谋生的体面工作，那你在工作之余，即使去参与这些虚幻不落地的运动，好歹还能敬你是条汉子，但如果你完全就躺在民运这个概念的历史簿上，没需求也去刻意的创造需求，那你和蛀虫又有啥区别呢？  2、经济不独立，思想不自由  说钱虽然庸俗，但现代社会的一个道理就是，如果你无法做到自我经济独立，那你绝对没有办法自由的思考，这也是民运人士的一大痛点，正如上面所说，相当数量的民运人士没有正儿八经的谋生技能和工作能力，当他们尝到运动可以拿到费用这个甜头后，无论是贪婪作祟还是无奈之举，都不可避免的陷入一个大滑坡，就是一切行动和行为，都要与运动组织者的意识形态保持一致，不管是忌惮费用停发还是党群攻击，哪怕有一点点的不同意见或者与组织相左的深度看法，都不敢发表，只能憋回肚子里去，至此，一个人，已经丧失了人格独立，没有了思想自由。  以上就是我对民运人士的一些整体看法，再多说几句，很多人有一个幻觉，以为自己不说，别人就看不穿自己，其实在现代社会里，你的出身、价值，都不是迷雾，都清清楚楚的，看看你日常的推文，看看你的公开活动，就可以知道你的生活状态和经济情况，你到底是一副行尸走肉还是闪烁着思想的光芒，更是一目了然。虽然我们说何频节目里造谣王很多，但有一些偏右的嘉宾就值得尊重，因为他们总是有一块自己的工作，不管是学术研究，还是具体的生意业务，他们可以先养活自己再去改变世界，这才是一个正常的人。  每次都要提一下王志安，相比民运分子，为什么王志安更值得尊重，他不懂战争，没那么激烈，甚至你可以说他懦弱不想流血，但是他所做的事情，是在他力所能及的范围内，帮助中国地区的民众开智，让中国社会运转的更好，这个和中共无关，只和最基本的信念和道义有关，这是个长期的工作，也是很艰难的工作，但可以感受到的是，这是一个踏踏实实的工作，这就是获得尊重的源泉。,2023-12-14T00:53:04,167,57,14

twitter/1749720588216918313,"FYI. I will not be voting in the Finnish Presidential elections for the first time in my adult life. This is for the simple reason that I don't see a candidate that would be driving the interests of the Finnish populace .  In actuality, each candidate seems to hold a view of the elite, which implies that they are hand-picked by them. This means that it does matter who you vote for, because the candidate will be pushing for one of the main agendas of the globalists, whether it's marginalizing the Russian-Finnish citizens, #CBDC or normalizing LGBT.   Most notably, no one is pushing for peace in #Ukraine , which at this point requires territorial concessions, nor is no one proposing normalization of relations with #Russia , which would be paramount for world peace. It's completely un-heard of that there's not a single candidate in the Finnish presidential elections with a peace-agenda.🤦  The whole election seems like a sick joke of the elite. That is why I consider not-voting to be the most patriotic act one can do in this situation. 🇫🇮 #presidentinvaalit2024 @Halla_aho @Haavisto @ollirehn @hjallisharkimo @liandersson @JuttaUrpilainen @SariEssayah @MikaAaltola @alexstubb",2024-01-23T17:07:51,609,133,96

twitter/1697638996191695299,在你明白这些道理后，你就不再焦虑了  1、人生只是一场体验: 人生只是一场体验，不必用来演绎完美，慢慢接纳自己身上那些晦暗的部分，原谅自己的迟钝和平庸，允许自己出错，允许事与愿违，接纳无常，带着缺憾拼命绽放，这是与自己达成和解的唯一办法。「追求生命的完整，而非完美。」当你一直主动发起与这个世界的撞击，你会知道，无论结果如何，所有撞击带来的回馈，都意味着你在真正地成长。  2、凡事发生，必将利于我: 这是查理芒格所坚持的，「我永远是幸存者，而非受害者」同理的强者心态。同一件事，弱者的关注点永远在于风险和损失，强者则看到机遇与成长，越把自己当弱者，越容易感受到伤害，丧失主观能动性，自此一蹶不振。  3、关于烦恼: 烦恼不需要被解决，只需要成长，成长到一定程度，认知维度打开，你会站在更高的视角看问题，很多困扰你的东西便不再是问题。  4、没有什么能真正伤害到你: 曾经有过严重的焦虑状态的我明白一件事，就是没有什么能真正伤害到你，那些令你焦虑恐惧的念头伤害不了你，那些人伤害不了你，他人的否定、不认同、贬低、中伤依旧伤害不了你。萦绕在你脑海中让你挥之不去的、隐忧地、烦扰你的那些恐惧、对未来之事的焦灼、灾难性后果的预设、各种风险和极端的可能性，只是大脑对你的欺骗。不要焦灼，沉下来，安定下来，静下心来，呼吸。情绪来临的时候不去反抗，任它蔓延到你的躯体，大脑，去观察，去体验，你可以质疑它，但不要去回应它，情绪来临的时候，不去拼死抵抗，就让它像水一般流走就行。  5、活在当下: 生命、人生不过是一场体验，没有什么东西是非要得到不可的。人生永远处于得与失之间，你失去了什么的时候也会得到些什么，一切非得到不可的东西只源于你内心的执念。你执着于结果，历尽千辛却求不得，信念便会崩塌，随之而来就是产生强烈的自我怀疑。想要什么就去做吧，不管你能否得到，不管最后结果能否拥有，不管人生的愿景能否实现，重要的是，聚焦当下，聚焦自我，积蓄能量，把注意力通通向外收回，少听少看少说，安住当下，就是活在此刻。,2023-09-01T23:54:11,208,6,82

And in this same moment, we are witnessing virulent calls for Jew hatred. Blind and foolish support for Hamas - a terror regime who on October 7th, 2023, violently massacred 1400 innocents in Israel, violently raped countless women and men, and took people of all ages including infants and toddlers as hostages.   The calls for Jew hatred and for blind support of the terror regime Hamas, did not start in the Arab world. It began on the streets and on campuses in New York, London, and throughout the Western world.   Hatred has no limits. The Holocaust was a result of the hatred for Jews. I believe that Holocaust education is critical for peace in the Middle East.  @AuschwitzMuseum @ABMFusa @AuschwitzJCF @IsraelinLA @HolocaustMuseum @hmla1961 @GermanAmbColo @USEmbSL @BakstHadas @Avigailcjm @KobbiShoshani @NaorGilon @tammybenhaim @GuyNirIL @ammwecofficial @AmericansAA  @USAmbGermany @ShoahFoundation @usbotschaft @USCShoahFdn @Imam1chalghoumi @ChabadOnCampus @HGIManhattan @eliewieselfdn @sharakango @anilaali",2024-05-12T01:09:29,5631,281,1062

twitter/1734885213505741097,"This conclusion is historic and insufficient. Historic because we finally have a global agreement naming fossil fuels as the problem and the source of the climate crisis and despite the oil lobby we held onto science based targets. Insufficient? You can read what the #cop28 text says. Let me tell you what it doesn’t say and why. It doesn’t say phasing out fossil fuels because these negotiations have been held in a stranglehold by the power of the fossil fuel producers for decades. That’s also what we see “energy systems” and the reference to “production” and emissions decline is gone. Those who stand to benefit from continuing to expand production of the products we know are killing us and we now have alternatives for have been effective in making sure there is no reference to absolute production decline for decades. Well congratulations OPEC you manage to squeak out another win but your team is weakening and you know it or you wouldn’t have sent that leaked letter to the Presidency.  It also doesn’t say equity because a very small number of people in the developed world are still making billions everyday off the backs of the developing world and our children’s future and they know equity opens the door to a transition that is fair and financed.   In order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and unite together to stand up to the oil industry and make a real plan to equitably phase out fossil fuels 12 courageous governments are now starting to design the plan for how to phase out fossil fuels under the @fossiltreaty.  More will join in the coming months. This COP kicked open the door to ending the fossil fuel era and we are not walking through it. We are marching through it with heads held high, behind the Pacific Island Nations who are leading the way and now with Colombia, Timor Leste and other fossil fuel producing nations who know that our health, our economies, our communities and a stable climate depend on more honesty, leadership and imagination than we saw in Dubai this week.",2023-12-13T18:37:22,458,49,219

Upon discovering this, we immediately reached out to the Toronto Public Library (TPL) to express our concerns about the lack of balance and the inappropriate content within the display, requesting that it be amended.  We are pleased to report that the TPL has taken prompt action in response to our concerns. The TPL have committed to adjusting the display to ensure it contains an accurate representation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Additionally, the poem 'If I Must Die' will be removed from the display.  The TPL has also assured us that they will continue to ensure accuracy in their materials and displays moving forward. This is a positive step towards ensuring that all community members feel represented and respected.

Your government’s disgraceful decision to disinvite Prince Reza Pahlavi from the Munich Security Conference (MSC), not once but twice, at the behest of Tehran, is an act of cowardice that will stain Germany’s reputation for years to come. It is a betrayal not only of the Iranian people who fight for freedom but also of Germany’s supposed commitment to democracy and human rights. What does it say about your country’s principles when it silences an advocate for freedom to appease a regime of hostage-takers and terrorists?  This appeasement goes beyond mere diplomatic blunders—it emboldens Tehran’s tyrants, encouraging more hostage diplomacy, more terror funding, and more violent crackdowns on Iranian dissidents. It also raises serious questions: Is Germany’s foreign policy dictated by a terrorist state? Has Berlin become so dependent on trade with Iran that it is willing to sacrifice its moral standing and integrity?  Germany’s complicity in Tehran’s crimes does not stop with the MSC debacle. Your government continues to allow Iranian banks—such as Bank Melli and Bank Sepah—to operate freely within your borders, despite their well-documented role in financing terrorism and military aggression. Your silence on the murder of German citizen Jamshid Sharmahd in an Iranian prison, along with your failure to hold the regime accountable, is nothing short of disgraceful. And now, with terrorist attacks unfolding on German soil, how much longer will you ignore the Islamist threat that your own policies have helped foster?  The German people deserve answers. Do you stand with the victims of tyranny and terror, or do you prioritize business deals with a regime that executes protesters and funds global jihadist networks? Do you uphold the values of democracy, or do you cower before the threats of dictators?  History will judge Germany’s complicity in enabling this regime. The Iranian people will remember who stood with them in their darkest hours—and who abandoned them for the sake of political expediency. It is not too late for Germany to correct this shameful course. Reinstate Prince Reza Pahlavi’s invitation to the MSC, cut financial ties with the Islamic Republic, and take a firm stand against Tehran’s terrorism.  Your actions, or lack thereof, will define Germany’s legacy in this struggle. Choose wisely.  $URL[0]",2025-02-14T06:46:25,77,2,36
twitter/1899965319520858133,"Translation:  Analysis of Khamenei’s Miscalculations and the Illusion of the Islamic Republic’s Survival  1. Khamenei’s Core Assumption: Lack of Simultaneity Between Internal Protests and External Attacks  The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic operates under the belief that if a foreign attack occurs, the Iranian people will remain passive, waiting for the outcome rather than actively contributing to the regime’s downfall. This assumption is based on several factors:  . Public Fatigue and Disillusionment: Years of repression, lack of cohesive leadership within the opposition, and previous failed attempts at change have led many to believe that internal transformation is impossible without external intervention. • Hope for a Cost-Free Change: Many may assume that the U.S. and Israel will intervene, much like in Iraq and Libya, removing the regime without requiring a mass uprising. . Regime Propaganda and Psychological Manipulation: Through state-controlled media and psychological operations, the Islamic Republic seeks to frame any foreign attack as an assault on Iran’s territorial integrity rather than an attack on the regime. This tactic is particularly effective among undecided segments of the population who fear instability more than they oppose the regime.  The belief that the Islamic Republic will fall without mass participation is a dangerous illusion. Several key reasons demonstrate why this assumption is incorrect:  . Foreign Attacks Alone Do Not Guarantee Regime Collapse: Past military interventions show that airstrikes and limited wars can severely weaken a regime’s military and economic infrastructure, but they do not necessarily lead to its downfall. Examples such as Syria, North Korea, and Venezuela prove that authoritarian governments can survive sanctions and military pressure. . People Are the Decisive Factor in Regime Change: Repressive regimes collapse primarily due to internal fractures. Nazi Germany only fell when both external and internal forces converged. In Iran, without widespread protests, strikes, and efforts to paralyze the regime’s security apparatus, external attacks will only delay the inevitable confrontation rather than resolve it. . Khamenei’s Tactics for Survival: The Islamic Republic is already preparing for potential foreign strikes: . Increased Internal Repression: The regime is intensifying executions, imprisoning activists, and restricting internet access to prevent any organized resistance. . Manipulating Nationalist Sentiments: By portraying itself as the defender of Iran’s sovereignty, the regime tries to convince the population that any attack is an attack on the nation itself rather than its authoritarian leadership. . Strengthening Ties with Russia and China: To counteract sanctions and military threats, the regime is deepening its reliance on Moscow and Beijing. However, these powers will prioritize their own interests over Tehran’s survival if the regime significantly weakens.  3. The Solution: Synchronizing Internal Protests with External Pressure  If Iranians want to ensure the definitive collapse of the Islamic Republic, they must escalate their protests and strikes precisely when external attacks occur. This would create a dual crisis for the regime, reducing its ability to respond effectively. • Building Internal Resistance Networks: Organizing decentralized resistance cells, secure communication channels, and underground movements will ensure effective coordination among dissidents. • Striking at the Regime’s Power Centers: While external forces weaken the regime militarily, nationwide strikes must paralyze key sectors like the oil industry, transportation, and security forces. • Breaking the Climate of Fear and Inaction: The regime’s primary strategy is to keep people afraid and passive. Through media efforts, accurate information dissemination, and boosting public morale, this fear-based control must be dismantled.  Conclusion  Khamenei correctly understands that if internal protests and external pressure occur simultaneously, the Islamic Republic will not survive. That is why he is doing everything possible to suppress any domestic unrest before a potential foreign military strike. However, the Iranian people must also recognize that waiting for the regime to fall without active participation only serves the regime’s interests.  Only the strategic coordination of internal uprisings with external pressure can bring about the final collapse of the Islamic Republic.",2025-03-13T07:26:46,40,1,16

twitter/1902321704761737653,"'New Syria. The Unquiet Border  After the bloody wave washed over the coast of Syria, reports of genocide began to slowly disappear from the information field. This is partly due to the recent visit of the head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry to Europe for tranches for 'an inclusive political transition,' as the EU stated.  At the same time, the Lebanese-Syrian border became unsettled. Serious battles with the use of MLRS and armored vehicles unfolded there after three HTS* fighters were killed by Lebanese tribesmen near the town of Al-Qasr. It was stated that they had entered Lebanese territory and wanted to steal cattle. The bodies were soon handed over to the new Syrian authorities, but all this led to an even greater round of bloodshed with dozens of wounded and dead.  The cause of the conflict, of course, is far from being a question of sheep or rams. This northern section of the border has a strong influence and presence of the Lebanese Hezbollah, the sworn enemy of the HTS* since the last war. And the population here has been predominantly Shiite for hundreds of years. During Assad's time, the border was not only a traditional fiefdom of smugglers, but also served as a channel for the supply of weapons to Hezbollah through Syria. Fighting has already broken out there several times, and the new authorities have shown intercepted weapons shipments in the media, signaling that 'things will never be like before.' And many former Assad soldiers and ordinary people went to Lebanon itself while they had the chance, realizing that they would face reprisals. Time has shown that they were right.  The situation was electrified and then after the spark it flared up. In addition to the tribes and obviously Hezbollah, the Lebanese army intervened in the recent clashes. Airstrikes were carried out on the artillery of HTS*. And it seems that the Defense Ministers of both countries agreed to cease fire - today there are again clashes for the border village of Khoush al-Sayyid Ali, where Shiites predominantly live. HTS* demonstrated modest military trophies and Hezbollah symbols in the morning. It is reported that civilians fled to Lebanese territory, and their houses are being looted and burned. The Lebanese army is about to enter the village.  Needless to say, this whole situation plays into Israel's hands. While these clashes are going on, it is bombing both Syria and southern Lebanon - although there is a ceasefire with Hezbollah. At the same time, Israel continues to expand its zone of control near the Golan Heights - today it brought about 50 armored vehicles into Quneitra. However, HTS* has neither the strength nor the will to fight the well-prepared Israel.  By the way, the major offensive of HTS* on Aleppo, which eventually led to the fall of Assad, began last year exactly the day after the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. Weakened by the war, Hezbollah withdrew most of its units from Aleppo, where many pro-Iranian formations were responsible for defense, to its homeland. As HTS* representatives later claimed, they no longer had time to postpone the offensive - the command decided to strike at the moment when Hezbollah quickly transferred fighters to help Assad in 'Syria. They decided not to attack Israel and the Party of Allah during the war, since in the Islamic world they could be accused of collaborating with Israel. Although who knows, who knows... In fact, that's what is happening.'  S. Shilov  * - terrorist organization  $URL[0]",2025-03-19T19:30:12,1,0,1

twitter/1820073426523972091,"Unsolicited Memo for UK from a descendant of an ungrateful colonist who served in the 4th Virginia Regiment of the Continental Line to create these United States of America:  In World War 2, the UK stood alone for 13 long months.  The UK, led by 70 year old Winston Churchill, saved Western Civilization.  Alone.  You did it.   If you are 70 it was your Mother and Father.  If you are 50 it was your Grandparents.  If you are 25 it was your Great-Grandparents.  Does their blood run through your body and brain or not?  The rulers you elected allowed mass immigration and gave the welfare state socialism - which you also voted for and take - to Muslims who are now 8.6% of your population.  For many of them, Islam is an identity only.  Those Islamists who actually believe in the Koran and Hadith are the enemies of Western Civilization.  They are conquering your country and you know it.   If enough is enough, then consider how only a dedicated one-third of the ungrateful colonists made our American Revolution happen.  It took 12 years before there was fighting.    And fighting is not what you should do.  If one third of the UK - 20m people - unite, they can't put you all in jail.  Massive civil disobedience works.  Look at the American Civil Rights movement which was profoundly Christian and borrowed non-violence from Gandhi.  Look at the Velvet Revolution in 1989 across Eastern Europe.  Look at where it was violent in Romania and a Baptist minister led the people to face the guns unafraid.  Rioting and looting and violence against dark-skinned people is self-destructive.  Control your youth and hot heads.   Stop them or you lose.  Take to the streets in the millions.  Peacefully.  Let the Islamists commit the outrages which will bring another 20m over to join you.  Eventually, the police and military will join you.  Or not enforce the orders against you - like what happened in Poland with Solidarity.  The 'Solidarity' solidly fueled by Catholic Christianity.     Come back to Lord Jesus Christ to find the courage to suffer, even die, for your freedom.  Align with the Hindus and others who love and honor the UK as you do as American Black Christians aligned with Jews in the US.  You don't have the weapons for another Peasants' Revolt or to do what you did with Charles 1 and 2 and Cromwell's son.  You gave up the weapons to defend your families.   Renounce and abjure violence.   You have the moral high ground.  You have the power that filled Richard the Lion-Hearted a prayer away.  When you regain self-rule in the UK, consider a couple of things.    I know Parliament is Sovereign.  But, maybe put some limits on Parliament to give yourself real freedom of speech.  You might want to re-arm.  Up to you, if and when, you restore and update the 'Rights of Englishmen.'  I know many of you will, appropriately, tell me to mind my own business.  Got it.  Not my fight (except it is as part of Western Civilization).  And, question my credentials for giving such suggestions.  When Virginia's General Assembly threatened our 2nd Amendment Rights, I joined about 40k of my fellow Virginians, many who were armed to the teeth, in our capitol in Jan 2020 at age 69.  The Pols backed down.  If they threaten my Rights again, I'll go out again at age 73.  I'll face any oppressor in my homeland.  I've almost died before.  Dying is not a threat at my age.   My comments are offered with the deepest respect for your history and accomplishments.  American Civilization is a stem off of your branch of Western Civilization.  You are our Mother Country.    We need each other to contain backward, barbaric Islamists.  We need to be peaceful to the point of martyrdom for Christ and freedom.  It takes real courage to be so.    You had it in WW 2.  You saved Western Civilization.  Bless you.  #EnoughisEnough",2024-08-04T20:24:54,41,9,11
